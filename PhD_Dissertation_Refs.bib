abstract = {Global budgets ascribe 4–10{\%} of atmospheric methane (CH4) sinks to upland soils and have assumed until recently that soils are the sole surface for CH4 exchange in upland forests. Here we report that CH4 is emitted from the stems of dominant tree species in a temperate upland forest, measured using both the traditional static-chamber method and a new high-frequency, automated system. Tree emissions averaged across 68 observations on 17 trees from May to September were 1.59 ± 0.88 µmol CH4 m-2stem h-1 (mean ± 95{\%} confidence interval), while soils adjacent to the trees consumed atmospheric CH4 at a rate of -4.52 ± 0.64 µmol CH4 m-2soil h-1 (P {\textless} 0.0001). High-frequency measurements revealed diurnal patterns in the rate of tree-stem CH4 emissions. A simple scaling exercise suggested that tree emissions offset 1–6{\%} of the growing season soil CH4 sink and may have briefly changed the forest to a net CH4 source. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {There is increasing interest in the measurement of methane (CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) emissions from tree stems in a wide range of ecosystems so as to determine how they contribute to the total ecosystem flux. To date, tree CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes are commonly measured using rigid closed chambers (static or dynamic), which often pose challenges as these are bulky and limit measurement of CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes to only a very narrow range of tree stem sizes and shapes. To overcome these challenges we aimed to design, describe and test new semi-rigid stem-flux chambers (or sleeves). We compared semi-rigid chamber's gas permeability to CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} against the traditional rigid chamber approach, in the laboratory and in the field, with continuous flow or syringe injections. We found that the semi-rigid chambers performed well, and had numerous benefits including reduced gas permeability and optimal stem gas exchange surface to total chamber volume ratio ({\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}c{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tot{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) allowing better headspace mixing, especially when connected in a dynamic mode to a continuous flow gas analyser. Semi-rigid sleeves can easily be constructed and transported in multiple sizes, are extremely light, cheap to build and fast to deploy. This makes them ideal for use in remote ecosystems where access logistics are complicated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Quantifying and understanding fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in natural soil-plant-atmosphere systems are crucial to predict global climate change. Wetland herbaceous species or tree species at waterlogged sites are known to emit large amounts of CH4. Upland forest soils are regarded as CH4 sinks and tree species like upland beech are not known to significantly emit CH4. Yet, data are scarce and this assumption needs to be tested. We combined measurements of soil-atmosphere and stem-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 and CH4, and soil gas profiles to assess the contribution of the different ecosystem compartments at two upland beech forest sites in Central Europe in a case study. Soil was a net CH4 sink at both sites, though emissions were detected consistently from beech stems at one site. Although stem emissions from beech stems were high compared to known fluxes from other upland tree species, they were substantially lower compared to the strong CH4 sink of the soil. Yet, we observed extraordinarily large CH4 emissions from one beech tree that was 140{\%} of the CH4 sink of the soil. The soil gas profile at this tree indicated CH4 production at a soil depth {\textgreater} 0.3m, despite the net uptake of CH4 consistently observed at the soil surface. Field soil assessment showed strong redoximorphic color patterns in the adjacent soil and supports this evaluation. We hypothesize that there is a transport link between the soil and stem via the root system representing a preferential transport mechanism for CH4 despite the fact that beech roots usually do not bear aerenchyma. The high mobility of gases requires a holistic view on the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Therefore, we recommend including field soil assessment and soil gas profiles measurements when investigating soil-atmosphere and stem-atmosphere fluxes to better understand the sources of gases and their transport mechanisms.},

abstract = {Forest soils and canopies are major components of ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes. In contrast, less is known about coarse woody debris and living tree stems, both of which function as active surfaces for CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes from soils, coarse woody debris, and tree stems over the growing season in an upland temperate forest. Soils were CO2 sources (4.58 ± 2.46 µmol m−2 s−1, mean ± 1 SD) and net sinks of CH4 (−2.17 ± 1.60 nmol m−2 s−1). Coarse woody debris was a CO2 source (4.23 ± 3.42 µmol m−2 s−1) and net CH4 sink, but with large uncertainty (−0.27 ± 1.04 nmol m−2 s−1) and with substantial differences depending on wood decay status. Stems were CO2 sources (1.93 ± 1.63 µmol m−2 s−1), but also net CH4 sources (up to 0.98 nmol m−2 s−1), with a mean of 0.11 ± 0.21 nmol m−2 s−1 and significant differences depending on tree species. Stems of N. sylvatica, F. grandifolia, and L. tulipifera consistently emitted CH4, whereas stems of A. rubrum, B. lenta, and Q. spp. were intermittent sources. Coarse woody debris and stems accounted for 35{\%} of total measured CO2 fluxes, whereas CH4 emissions from living stems offset net soil and CWD CH4 uptake by 3.5{\%}. Our results demonstrate the importance of CH4 emissions from living stems in upland forests and the need to consider multiple forest components to understand and interpret ecosystem CO2 and CH4 dynamics.

abstract = {CO2 and CH4 fluxes were monitored over 4 years in a range of taiga forests along the Tanana River in interior Alaska. Floodplain alder and white spruce sites and upland birch/aspen and white spruce sites were examined. Each site had control, fertilized, and sawdust amended plots; flux measurements began during the second treatment year. CO2 emissions decreased with successional age across the sites (alder, birch/aspen, and white spruce, in order of succession) regardless of landscape position. Although CO2 fluxes showed an exponential relationship with soil temperature, the response of CO2 production to moisture fit an asymptotic model. Of the manipulations, only N fertilization had an effect on CO2 flux, decreasing flux in the floodplain sites but increasing it in the birch/aspen site. Landscape position was the best predictor of CH4 flux. The two upland sites consumed CH4 at similar rates (approximately 0.5 mg C m−2 d−1), whereas the floodplain sites had lower consumption rates (0–0.3 mg C m−2 d−1). N fertilization and sawdust both inhibited CH4 consumption in the upland birch/aspen and floodplain spruce sites but not in the upland spruce site. The biological processes driving CO2 fluxes were sensitive to temperature, moisture, and vegetation, whereas CH4 fluxes were sensitive primarily to landscape position and biogeochemical disturbances. Hence, climate change effects on C-gas flux in taiga forest soils will depend on the relationship between soil temperature and moisture and the concomitant changes in soil nutrient pools and cycles.},

abstract = {Abstract Soil-atmosphere fluxes of trace gases (especially nitrous oxide (N2O)) can be significant during winter and at snowmelt. We investigated the effects of decreases in snow cover on soil freezing and trace gas fluxes at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA. We manipulated snow depth by shoveling to induce soil freezing, and measured fluxes of N2O, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in field chambers monthly (bi-weekly at snowmelt) in stands dominated by sugar maple or yellow birch. The snow manipulation and measurements were carried out in two winters (1997/1998 and 1998/1999) and measurements continued through 2000. Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 showed a strong seasonal pattern, with low rates in winter, but N2O fluxes did not show strong seasonal variation. The snow manipulation induced soil freezing, increased N2O flux and decreased CH4 uptake in both treatment years, especially during winter. Annual N2O fluxes in sugar maple treatment plots were 207 and 99 mg N m-2 yr-1 in 1998 and 1999 vs. 105 and 42 in reference plots. Tree species had no effect on N2O or CO2 fluxes, but CH4 uptake was higher in plots dominated by yellow birch than in plots dominated by sugar maple. Our results suggest that winter fluxes of N2O are important and that winter climate change that decreases snow cover will increase soil:atmosphere N2O fluxes from northern hardwood forests.},

abstract = {Atmospheric methane plays a major role in controlling climate, yet contemporary methane trends (1982-2017) have defied explanation with numerous, often conflicting, hypotheses proposed in the literature. Specifically, atmospheric observations of methane from 1982 to 2017 have exhibited periods of both increasing concentrations (from 1982 to 2000 and from 2007 to 2017) and stabilization (from 2000 to 2007). Explanations for the increases and stabilization have invoked changes in tropical wetlands, livestock , fossil fuels, biomass burning, and the methane sink. Contradictions in these hypotheses arise because our current observational network cannot unambiguously link recent methane variations to specific sources. This raises some fundamental questions: (i) What do we know about sources, sinks, and underlying processes driving observed trends in atmospheric methane? (ii) How will global methane respond to changes in anthropogenic emissions? And (iii), What future observations could help resolve changes in the methane budget? To address these questions, we discuss potential drivers of atmospheric methane abundances over the last four decades in light of various observational constraints as well as process-based knowledge. While uncertainties in the methane budget exist, they should not detract from the potential of methane emissions mitigation strategies. We show that net-zero cost emission reductions can lead to a declining atmospheric burden, but can take three decades to stabilize. Moving forward, we make recommendations for observations to better constrain contemporary trends in atmospheric methane and to provide mitigation support. methane trends | greenhouse gas mitigation | tropospheric oxidative capacity},

abstract = {The arrival of space-based imaging radar as a revolutionary land-surface mapping and monitoring tool little more than a quarter century ago enabled a spate of innovative volcano research worldwide. Soon after launch of European Space Agency's ERS-1 spacecraft in 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey began SAR and InSAR studies of volcanoes in the Aleutian and Cascades arcs, in Hawaiʻi, and elsewhere in the western U.S. including the Yellowstone and Long Valley calderas. This paper summarizes results of that effort and presents new findings concerning: (1) prevalence of volcano deformation in the Aleutian and Cascade arcs; (2) surface-change detection and hazard assessment during eruptions at Aleutian and Hawaiian volcanoes; (3) geodetic imaging of magma storage and transport systems in Hawaiʻi; and (4) deformation sources and processes at the Yellowstone and Long Valley calderas. Surface deformation caused by a variety of processes is common in arc settings and could easily escape detection without systematic InSAR surveillance. Space-based SAR imaging of active lava flows and domes in remote or heavily vegetated settings, including during periods of bad weather and darkness, extends land-based monitoring capabilities and improves hazards assessments. At Kīlauea Volcano, comprehensive SAR and InSAR observations identify multiple magma storage zones beneath the summit area and along the East Rift Zone, and illuminate magma transport pathways. The same approach at Yellowstone tracks the ascent of magmatic volatiles from a mid-crustal intrusion to shallow depth and relates that process to increased hydrothermal activity at the surface. Together with recent and planned launches of highly capable imaging-radar satellites, these findings support an optimistic outlook for near-real time surveillance of volcanoes at global scale in the coming decade.},

abstract = {We use a combination of satellite radar and GPS data to estimate the slip distribution of the 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine Earthquake, a right-lateral strikeslip earthquake that occurred on a northwest–southeast striking fault in the southern California Mojave Desert. The data include synthetic aperture radar interferograms (InSAR) from both ascending and descending orbits, radar amplitude image offset fields (SARIO) for both ascending and descending azimuth directions, and campaign GPS observations from 55 stations provided by Agnew et al. (2002). We model the fault with nine segments derived from the field-mapped fault rupture, the SARIO data, and aftershock locations. We first estimate the dip of each fault segment, as well as a single constant strike-slip component across each segment, resulting in an average dip of 83° to the northeast and slip of up to 5.6 m. Then, we fix the optimal fault segment dip, discretize the fault segments into 1.5 km × 1.5 km patches, and solve for the variable slip distribution using a nonnegative least-squares method that includes an appropriate degree of smoothing. Our preferred solution has both right-lateral strike-slip and reverse faulting. The estimated geodetic moment is 5.93 × 1019 N m (Mw 7.1), similar to seismological estimates, indicating that there are insignificant interseismic and postseismic deformation signals in the data. We find strike-slip displacements of up to 6.0 m and reverse faulting of up to 1.6 m, with the maximum slip located just northwest of the epicenter. Most of the slip is concentrated northwest and south of the epicenter; little slip is found on the northeastern branch of the fault. The SARIO data and our modeling indicate that the amount and extent of surface fault rupture were underestimated in the field.},

abstract = {B ig data affects increasingly many aspects of our lives. The large volumes of data gathered and stored form the basis of the recommendations we receive when shopping online and the way in which we connect to people all over the world via social media 1. Naturally, this has led to debates about how increasing volumes of data and new analytic tools might impact scientific research. An emerging view is that largely theory-free data-driven models will supplant models that explicitly start from theory 2,3. Big data could have big potential in various scientific disciplines 4 including climate research 5,6 , but it remains unclear what questions big data can potentially help to answer. The usefulness of big data and the associated epistemological shifts are of particular importance for climate research for three reasons. First, the already large volumes of current climate data are expected to increase further in both volume and complexity over the coming years and decades 7. Second, approaches typically associated with big data have already entered climate research 5 (for examples see refs. 8-10). Third, climate models are rooted in scientific theory, which is one of the key reasons for confidence in their projections 11. This makes climate research an interesting test case for the suggested shift from process-based to largely theory-free modelling. A prevailing problem concerning big data is the fuzziness around the terminology. To date, there is no consensus definition of big data or related concepts such as data-intensive science, data-driven science and big-data science. Based on suggested definitions of these terms 12,13 , we adopt a conception of big data that focuses on the characteristics of data and the tools used to analyse them. The data are often voluminous streams of partly unstructured and heterogeneous data (characterized by the 'three Vs': volume, velocity and variety) and can be noisy and uncertain compared to more standardized datasets (indicated by a fourth V, veracity) 14,15. The tools used to analyse them are machine learning and data mining, ranging from simple linear regression tools to complex non-linear models in deep learning 16,17. Small problems Many commercial problems are solved using pure big-data approaches; a typical example is the problem of predicting online consumer preferences such as online book recommendations with pure big data, which use data on how customers react to different books. An algorithm analyses these data and automatically identifies similar books. Both successful and unsuccessful recommendations inform future recommendations 1. The problem of recommending the right books to the right customers constitutes a well-posed problem with a clear measure of success and fast evaluation of the predictions: the customer looks at the book or buys it. As wrong predictions are hard to avoid and contribute to improving the predictions, pure big data is usually applied when the impact or the probability of wrong predictions is small.

abstract = {Volcanic gas emissions are intimately linked to the dynamics of magma ascent and outgassing, and, on geological timescales, constitute an important source of volatiles to the Earth's atmosphere. Measurements of gas composition and flux are therefore critical to both volcano monitoring and to determining the contribution of volcanoes to global geochemical cycles. However, significant gaps remain in our global inventories of volcanic emissions, (particularly for CO 2 , which requires proximal sampling of a concentrated plume) for those volcanoes where the near-vent region is hazardous or inaccessible. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide a robust and effective solution to proximal sampling of dense volcanic plumes in extreme volcanic environments. Here, we present gas compositional data acquired using a gas sensor payload aboard a UAS flown at Volc{\'{a}}n Villarrica, Chile. We compare UAS-derived gas timeseries to simultaneous crater rim multi-GAS data and UV camera imagery to investigate early plume evolution. SO 2 concentrations measured in the young proximal plume exhibit periodic variations that are well-correlated with the concentrations of other species. By combining molar gas ratios (CO 2 /SO 2 = 1.48-1.68, H 2 O/SO 2 = 67-75 and H 2 O/CO 2 = 45-51) with the SO 2 flux (142 ± 17 t/day) from UV camera images, we derive CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes of {\~{}}150 t/day and {\~{}}2850 t/day, respectively.

abstract = {Accurate assessments of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the climate policy process, and project future climate change. Present-day analysis requires the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. Here we describe datasets and a methodology developed by the global carbon cycle science community to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates, consistency within and among components, and methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production (EFF) are based on energy statistics, while emissions from Land- Use Change (ELUC), including deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land cover change data, fire activity in regions undergoing deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (S OCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. Finally, the global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (S LAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms. For the last decade available (2002–2011), EFF was 8.3 ± 0.4 PgC yr−1, ELUC 1.0 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1, GATM 4.3 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1, S OCEAN 2.5 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1, and S LAND 2.6 ± 0.8 PgC yr−1. For year 2011 alone, EFF was 9.5 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1, 3.0 percent above 2010, reflecting a continued trend in these emissions; ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1, approximately constant throughout the decade; GATM was 3.6 ± 0.2 PgC yr−1, S OCEAN was 2.7 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1, and S LAND was 4.1 ± 0.9 PgC yr−1. GATM was low in 2011 compared to the 2002–2011 average because of a high uptake by the land probably in response to natural climate variability associated to La Ni˜na conditions in the Pacific Ocean. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 391.31 ± 0.13 ppm at the end of year 2011. We estimate that EFF will have increased by 2.6{\%} (1.9–3.5 {\%}) in 2012 based on projections of gross world product and recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy. All uncertainties are reported as ±1 sigma (68{\%} confidence assuming Gaussian error distributions that the real value lies within the given interval), reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. This paper is intended to provide a baseline to keep track of annual carbon budgets in the future.},

abstract = {Efforts to limit climate change below a given temperature level require that global emissions of CO2 cumulated over time remain below a limited quota. This quota varies depending on the temperature level, the desired probability of staying below this level and the contributions of other gases. In spite of this restriction, global emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and cement production have continued to grow by 2.5{\%} per year on average over the past decade. Two thirds of the CO2 emission quota consistent with a 2 [deg]C temperature limit has already been used, and the total quota will likely be exhausted in a further 30 years at the 2014 emissions rates. We show that CO2 emissions track the high end of the latest generation of emissions scenarios, due to lower than anticipated carbon intensity improvements of emerging economies and higher global gross domestic product growth. In the absence of more stringent mitigation, these trends are set to continue and further reduce the remaining quota until the onset of a potential new climate agreement in 2020. Breaking current emission trends in the short term is key to retaining credible climate targets within a rapidly diminishing emission quota.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of methane (CH4 ) emissions is of paramount importance because CH4 has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Wetlands are the single largest natural CH4 source with median emissions from published studies of 164 Tg yr(-1) , which is about a third of total global emissions. We provide a perspective on important new frontiers in obtaining a better understanding of CH4 dynamics in natural systems, with a focus on wetlands. One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review. Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global CH4 emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over CH4 emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in CH4 biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and CH4 dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of CH4 models. We highlight throughout some of the most pressing issues concerning global change and feedbacks on CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems. Major uncertainties in estimating current and future CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over CH4 production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing CH4 biogeochemistry models. (ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes. (iii) The limited number of observations of CH4 fluxes and their associated environmental variables loosely constrains the parameterization of process-based biogeochemistry models.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, shale gas production has increased from negligible to providing .40{\%} of national gas and 14{\%} of all fossil fuel energy in the USA in 2013. This shale gas is often promoted as a bridge fuel that allows society to continue to use fossil fuels while reducing carbon emissions since less carbon dioxide is emitted from natural gas (including shale gas) than from coal and oil per unit of heat energy. Indeed, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use in the USA declined to some extent between 2009 and 2013, mostly due to economic recession but in part due to replacement of coal by natural gas. However, significant quantities of methane are emitted into the atmosphere from shale gas development: an estimated 12{\%} of total production considered over the full life cycle from well to delivery to consumers, based on recent satellite data. Methane is an incredibly powerful greenhouse gas that is .100-fold greater in absorbing heat than carbon dioxide, while both gases are in the atmosphere and 86-fold greater when averaged over a 20-year period following emission. When methane emissions are included, the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas is significantly larger than that of conventional natural gas, coal, and oil. Because of the increase in shale gas development over recent years, the total greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use in the USA rose between 2009 and 2013, despite the decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. Given the projections for continued expansion of shale gas production, this trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels is predicted to continue through 2040.},

abstract = {Global carbon cycle models suggest that CO2 degassing from the solid Earth has been a primary control of paleoatmospheric CO2 contents and through the greenhouse effect, of global paleotemperatures. Be-cause such models utilize simplified and indirect as-sumptions about CO2 degassing, improved quantifica-tion is warranted. Present-day CO2 degassing provides a baseline for modeling the global carbon cycle and pro-vides insight into the geologic regimes of paleodegas-sing. Mid-ocean ridges (MORs) discharge 1-3 x 1012 mol/yr of CO2 and consume ---3.5 x 10 TM mol/yr of CO2 by carbonate formation in MOR hydrothermal systems. Excluding MORs as a net source of CO2 to the atmo-sphere, the total CO2 discharge from subaerial volca-nism is estimated at ---2.0-2.5 x 10 • 2 mol/yr. Because this flux is lower than estimates of the global consump-tion of atmospheric CO2 by subaerial silicate weather-ing, other CO2 sources are required to balance the global carbon cycle. Nonvolcanic CO2 degassing (i.e., emission not from the craters or flanks of volcanos), which is prevalent in high heat flow regimes that are primarily located at plate boundaries, could contribute the additional CO2 that is apparently necessary to bal-ance the global carbon cycle. Oxidation of methane emitted from serpentinization of ultramafics and from thermocatalysis of organic matter provides an addi-tional, albeit unquantified, source of CO2 to the atmo-sphere. Magmatic CO2 degassing was probably a major contributor to global warming during the Cretaceous. Metamorphic CO2 degassing from regimes of shallow, pluton-related low-pressure regional metamorphism may have significantly contributed to global warming during the Cretaceous and Paleocene/Eocene. CO2 de-gassing associated with continental rifting of Pangaea may have contributed to the global warming that was initiated in the Jurassic. During the Cretaceous, global warming initiated by CO2 degassing of flood basalts, and consequent rapid release of large quantities of CH 4 by decomposition of gas hydrates (clathrates), could have caused widespread extinctions of organisms.},

abstract = {Anomalous concentrations of CO2and, to a lesser extent, CH4have been detected over many active geothermal systems. The production of these gases, and of N2O, can be affected by both geothermal and biological processes. In this investigation, soil gas and soil-gas fluxes were measured at the Cove Fort-Sulphurdale geothermal field in Utah, which produces steam from both liquid- and vapor-dominated portions of the resource. The objectives were to determine the sources of these gases, the factors controlling their production, and the potential application to surface exploration and reservoir evaluation. Flux measurements were made in both summer and winter to evaluate and to quantify variations in seasonal noise. Carbon dioxide in soil gas, and in fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere during the summer sampling were dominated by soil respiration processes. During the winter, a geothermal component was visible. Methane fluxes were small negative values during the summer months, reflecting methanotrophic oxidation of atmospheric CH4and, possibly, geothermal CH4in the soils. Nitrous oxide in soil gas and in soil-gas fluxes to the atmosphere also varied seasonally. Surprisingly high concentrations were observed at locations directly above the steam cap. We suggests that NH3produced in the geothermal reservoir by the Haber reaction was seeping upward where it was biologically oxidized to NO3-. This oxidation, and possible localized biological reduction of NO3-to N2, produced moderate amounts of N2O, averaging three times typical background flux rates and ten times background over the central portion of the geothermal area. There were higher fluxes of CO2, CH4and N2O over the steam cap and the surrounding area, relative to background values. The high flux may reflect seepage of gas along faults that intersect the more extensive liquid-dominated portion of the reservoir. Nitrous oxide measurements in soil gas and soil-gas fluxes to the atmosphere offer promise as an exploration and reservoir characterization tool. (C) 2000 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ocean acidification means that calcium carbonate—the material with which coral reefs are built—will be more difficult for organisms to generate and will dissolve more quickly. Eyre et al. report that some reefs are already experiencing net sediment dissolution. Worryingly, the rates of loss will increase as ocean acidification intensifies.Science, this issue p. 908Ocean acidification refers to the lowering of the ocean's pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. Coral reef calcification is expected to decrease as the oceans become more acidic. Dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO3) sands could greatly exacerbate reef loss associated with reduced calcification but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO3 dissolution in reef sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$ar) of overlying seawater and that CaCO3 sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral calcification. Consequently, reef sediments globally will transition from net precipitation to net dissolution when seawater $\Omega$ar reaches 2.92 ± 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE). Notably, some reefs are already experiencing net sediment dissolution.},

Compared with meticulous measurement and calibration of isotopic CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} in the atmosphere, there has been relatively little effort to characterize globally representative isotopic source signatures, particularly for fossil fuel sources, since the 1980s. Most global CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} budget models have so far relied on outdated source signature values derived from globally non-representative data. To correct this deficiency, we present a comprehensive, globally representative end-member database of the $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C and $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}H of CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} from fossil fuel (conventional natural gas, shale gas and coal), modern microbial (wetlands, rice paddies, ruminants, termites, and landfills/waste) and biomass burning sources. Alkane and permanent gas molecular chemistry for fossil fuel categories are also included with the database. The database comprises 10,706 samples (8,734 fossil fuel, 1972 non-fossil) from 190 published references. Mean (unweighted) $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C signatures for fossil fuel CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are significantly lighter than values commonly used in CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} budget models, thus highlighting potential under-estimation of fossil fuel CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions in previous CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} budget models.

abstract = {Global methane (CH4) emissions are becoming increasingly important due to the contribution of CH4 to global warming. Leaking oil and gas wells can lead to subsurface CH4 gas migration (GM), which can cause both aquifer contamination and atmospheric emissions. Despite the need to identify and quantify GM at oil and gas well pads, effective and reliable monitoring techniques are lacking. In this field study, we used CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux measurements together with soil gas stable carbon isotopic signatures to identify the occurrence and to characterize the spatio-temporal migration of fugitive gas across 17 selected well pads in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada. At 13 of these sites, operators had previously reported the occurrence of GM; however, subsequent inspections based on visual, olfactory or auditory evidence only identified GM at two of these sites. Using the soil gas efflux method, evidence for GM was found at 15 of the 17 well pads with CH4 and CO2 effluxes ranging from 0.017 to 180 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1(0.024 to 250 g CH4 m−2 d−1) and 0.50 to 32 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1 (1.9 to 122 g CO2 m−2 d−1), respectively. Stable carbon isotopic composition was assessed at 10 of the 17 well pads with 9 well pads showing evidence of GM. The isotopic values indicated that CH4 in soil gas was from the same origin as CH4 in the surface casing vent flow gas. There was no correlation between CH4 effluxes and the distance from the well head; an equal portion of elevated effluxes were detected {\textgreater}10 m from the well head as were detected {\textless}5 m from the well head. In addition, CH4 effluxes varied temporally with values changing by up to an order of magnitude over 2 h. Although the study was carried out in Northeastern British Columbia, the results are applicable on a global scale, suggesting that inspections mostly based on visual evidence (e.g. bubbling at the well head) are not reliable for the identification of GM and, that infrequent survey measurements at predefined locations close to the well head may overestimate, underestimate or even miss CH4 effluxes. Repetitive and relatively densely spaced gas efflux measurements using a dynamic closed chamber method proved to be a useful tool for detecting GM.},

abstract = {Valles caldera (New Mexico, USA) is the type example of a resurgent caldera and source of the Tshirege Member, Bandelier Tuff, which has been long recognized as a normally zoned sequence of ignimbrites. In this paper, we present geologic, stratigraphic, chemical, and mineralogical data from upper flow units of the Tshirege Member obtained at multiple sites within and east of Valles caldera showing that the upper part of the Tshirege Member is reverse-zoned in chemistry and mineralogy. The key to deciphering these compositional changes in zoning is recognition of flow unit Qbt4u, which we informally name the high Ti-Ba unit or HTBU. The HTBU is widespread within the resurgent dome area of the caldera, but is only found in a small area outside and east of the caldera. The HTBU is the most "mafic" unit in the Tshirege Member and is identified by chemical maxima in Ti, Ba, Sr, P, V, and Th, and by unusually high contents of anorthoclase, plagioclase, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, apatite and zircon with respect to other flow units. The HTBU also contains small (≤. 1. cm) enclaves of quenched andesitic magma consisting primarily of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, glass and vesicles. Later erupted Tshirege flow units Qbt5l and Qbt5u are chemically more evolved and contain less plagioclase, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, apatite and zircon than the HTBU, and they are more evolved than flow units erupted before the HTBU (approximately 90{\%} of the Tshirege Member). The HTBU is the host ignimbrite of a complex vent breccia exposed for over 3. km along the NW faulted face of Redondo Peak, the Valles caldera resurgent dome. Breccia clasts consist of angular to subrounded fragments ≤. 1. m in diameter of Permian red beds, Miocene basin fill sediments, Miocene to Pliocene volcanics and Quaternary ignimbrite (Otowi Member, Bandelier Tuff) that underlie Valles caldera. Flow units Qbt5l and Qbt5u overlie the HTBU vent breccia but these later units do not contain unusual quantities of lithic fragments. Significantly, small mudstone lithic fragments (generally ≤. 200. $\mu$m in diameter) in the HTBU vent breccia contain reaction rinds of secondary garnet (andradite) along margins with ignimbrite host. We argue that the tiny andradite crystals (≤. 50. $\mu$m) formed by reaction of degassing volatiles in the vent area with relatively Fe-Ca-rich vent breccia fragments at temperatures approaching 800. °C and pressures less than a few MPa. Geologic relations and the restricted distribution of upper Tshirege flow units Qbt3t to Qtb5u indicate they were erupted in a short period of time (weeks to months) from a centralized vent near Redondo Peak, and from other buried vents as far east as the eastern ring fracture. We also conclude that late injection of andesitic melt into the residual Bandelier magma chamber stimulated the eruption of upper Tshirege Member pyroclastic flows from different locations and depths of the chamber resulting in a small but significant reversal in chemical and mineralogical zonation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present data that elucidate the stratigraphy, geomorphology, and structure in the western part of Los Alamos National Laboratory between Technical Areas 3 and 16 (TA-3 and TA-16). Data include those gathered by geologic mapping of surficial, post-Bandelier Tuff strata, conventional and high-precision geologic mapping and geochemical analysis of cooling units within the Bandelier Tuff, logging of boreholes and a gas pipeline trench, and structural analysis using profiles, cross sections, structure contour maps, and stereographic projections. This work contributes to an improved understanding of the paleoseismic and geomorphic history of the area, which will aid in future seismic hazard evaluations and other investigations. The study area lies at the base of the main, 120-m (400-ft) high escarpment formed by the Pajarito fault, an active fault of the Rio Grande rift that bounds Los Alamos National Laboratory on the west. Subsidiary fracturing, faulting, and folding associated with the Pajarito fault zone extends at least 1,500 m (5,000 ft) to the east of the main Pajarito fault escarpment. Stratigraphic units in the study area include upper units of the Tshirege Member of the early Pleistocene Bandelier Tuff, early Pleistocene alluvial fan deposits that predate incision of canyons on this part of the Pajarito Plateau, and younger Pleistocene and Holocene alluvium and colluvium that postdate drainage incision. We discriminate four sets of structures in the area between TA-3 and TA-16: (a) north-striking faults and folds that mark the main zone of deformation, including a graben in the central part of the study area; (b) north-northwest-striking fractures and rare faults that bound the eastern side of the principal zone of deformation and may be the surface expression of deep-seated faulting; (c) rare northeast-striking structures near the northern limit of the area associated with the southern end of the Rendija Canyon fault; and (d) several small east-west-striking faults. We consider all structures to be Quaternary in that they postdate the Tshirege Member (1.22 million years old) of the Bandelier Tuff. Older mesa-top alluvial deposits (Qoal), which may have a large age range but are probably in part about 1.13 million years old, are clearly faulted or deformed by many structures. At two localities, younger alluvial units (Qfo and Qfi) appear to be truncated by faults, but field relations are obscure, and we cannot confirm the presence of fault contacts. The youngest known faulting in the study area occurred in Holocene time on a down-to-the-west fault, recently trenched at the site of a new LANL Emergency Operations Center (Reneau et al. 2002).},

abstract = {New 40Ar/39Ar dates from the Jemez Mountain volcanic field (JMVF) reveal formerly unrecognized shifts in the loci of pre-caldera volcanic centers across the northern Jemez Mountains; these shifts are interpreted to coincide with episodes of Rio Grande rift faulting. Early activity in the field includes two eruptive pulses: 10.8–9.2 Ma basaltic to dacitic volcanism on Lobato Mesa in the northeastern JMVF and 12–9 Ma mafic to silicic volcanism in the southwestern JMVF. While 9–7 Ma eruptions persisted in the southern JMVF, a new eruptive center developed on the La Grulla Plateau in the northwestern JMVF (8.7–7.2 Ma), corresponding with a period of rift widening caused by reactivation of Laramide faults in this area. The older 8.7–7.8 Ma mafic lavas emitted from Encino Point and the younger 7.7–7.2 Ma trachyandesite and dacite erupted on the La Grulla Plateau are assigned to a new unit called the La Grulla Formation. The chemical composition of a 640 m stack of lava flows exposed in the northern margin of the Valles caldera changes from dacite to andesite, then back to dacite upsection, becoming slightly more alkalic upward. The shift to more alkalic compositions occurs across a sedimentary break, marking a subtle change in magma source for the older Paliza Canyon Formation and the younger La Grulla Formation lavas. New age constraints from a rhyolite intrusion in the southern JMVF and pumiceous rhyolite deposits in the northern JMVF suggest an episode of localized, 7.6–7.8 Ma rhyolitic volcanism that occurred in the central part of the JMVF between 12–8 Ma Canovas Canyon Rhyolite and 7–6 Ma peak Bearhead Rhyolite volcanism. Younger Bearhead Rhyolite intrusions (7.1–6.5 Ma) are more widespread than previously documented, extending into the northeastern JMVF. Tschicoma Formation dacite erupted at 5 Ma in the Sierra de los Valles and then erupted throughout the northeastern JMVF 5–2 Ma. The more refined geochronology of the JMVF indicates that pre-caldera volcanic centers were characterized by geographically and chemically distinct, relatively short-lived, episodes of activity. Volcanism generally migrated eastward through time in the southern JMVF, but the pattern in the northern JMVF had a more complex east (10–9 Ma) to west (9–7 Ma) to east (5–2 Ma) pattern that reflects the timing of motion on faults. The new ages, coupled with detailed mapping of both volcanic rocks and the Santa Fe Group, document significant pulses of faulting, erosion, and deposition during middle Miocene time and during late Miocene time across the Ca{\~{n}}ones fault zone in the northern JMVF.},

abstract = {Dynamic accumulation chamber methods have been extensively used to estimate the total output of CO2released from active volcanic area. In order to asses the performance and reliability of a closed dynamic system several tests were carried out with different soil permeabilities and soil CO2fluxes. A special device was used to create a constant one-dimensional CO2flux through a soil column with a known permeability. Three permeabilities were investigated, ranging between 3.6 × 10- 2and 3.5 × 10 $\mu$m2, as were several CO2fluxes (ranging between 1.1 × 10- 6and 6.3 × 10- 5 kg m- 2s- 1). The results highlight that the accuracy of soil CO2flux measurements strictly depends on the soil gas permeability and the soil CO2flux regimen. Generally chamber measurements underestimate CO2fluxes at low soil permeability and low soil CO2fluxes, whereas appreciable overestimations occur for high permeability soil, especially for high soil CO2fluxes. Other tests carried out with different settings for the measurement device, such as the chamber volume and the flux of the pump used to recirculate air through the chamber and the gas analyzer (recirculation flux), revealed a strong dependence of the closed dynamic chamber measurements on the recirculation flux. Low recirculation fluxes (0.2-0.4 l min- 1) decreased the performance of the measurement system, causing underestimations of the actual soil CO2flux, whereas higher values (0.6-1.0 l min- 1) resulted in overestimations, especially for elevated soil CO2fluxes. An empirical equation was deduced to allow accumulation chamber fluxes to be calculated very accurately based on soil gas permeabilities measured in the field. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the comparison between CRDS and GC showed that enclosure times as short as 600s for our field study site are suitable to estimate the same treatment effects, but not necessarily flux magnitude.

abstract = {Closed (non-steady state) chambers are widely used for quantifying carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes between soils or low-stature canopies and the atmosphere. It is well recognised that covering a soil or vegetation by a closed chamber inherently disturbs the natural CO 2 fluxes by al-tering the concentration gradients between the soil, the veg-etation and the overlying air. Thus, the driving factors of CO 2 fluxes are not constant during the closed chamber ex-periment, and no linear increase or decrease of CO 2 con-centration over time within the chamber headspace can be expected. Nevertheless, linear regression has been applied for calculating CO 2 fluxes in many recent, partly influential, studies. This approach has been justified by keeping the clo-sure time short and assuming the concentration change over time to be in the linear range. Here, we test if the application of linear regression is really appropriate for estimating CO 2 fluxes using closed chambers over short closure times and if the application of nonlinear regression is necessary. We de-veloped a nonlinear exponential regression model from dif-fusion and photosynthesis theory. This exponential model was tested with four different datasets of CO 2 flux measure-ments (total number: 1764) conducted at three peatlands sites in Finland and a tundra site in Siberia. Thorough analy-ses of residuals demonstrated that linear regression was fre-quently not appropriate for the determination of CO 2 fluxes by closed-chamber methods, even if closure times were kept short. The developed exponential model was well suited for nonlinear regression of the concentration over time c(t) evo-Correspondence to: L. Kutzbach (kutzbach@uni-greifswald.de) lution in the chamber headspace and estimation of the initial CO 2 fluxes at closure time for the majority of experiments. However, a rather large percentage of the exponential regres-sion functions showed curvatures not consistent with the the-oretical model which is considered to be caused by viola-tions of the underlying model assumptions. Especially the effects of turbulence and pressure disturbances by the cham-ber deployment are suspected to have caused unexplainable curvatures. CO 2 flux estimates by linear regression can be as low as 40{\%} of the flux estimates of exponential regression for closure times of only two minutes. The degree of under-estimation increased with increasing CO 2 flux strength and was dependent on soil and vegetation conditions which can disturb not only the quantitative but also the qualitative eval-uation of CO 2 flux dynamics. The underestimation effect by linear regression was observed to be different for CO 2 uptake and release situations which can lead to stronger bias in the daily, seasonal and annual CO 2 balances than in the individ-ual fluxes. To avoid serious bias of CO 2 flux estimates based on closed chamber experiments, we suggest further tests us-ing published datasets and recommend the use of nonlinear regression models for future closed chamber studies.},

abstract = {Continuous changes in methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations inside a closed chamber were measured on the forest floor at three sites: a deciduous forest and a coniferous forest in Hokkaido, Japan, and a birch forest in West Siberia, Russian Federation. Flux estimations by three types of regression methods, exponential, nonlinear, and linear, were examined using field-collected concentration data. The pattern of change with time of the gas concentration in the headspace differed, mainly according to site but also, to a lesser extent, according to the gas. This was a function of both the chamber height and surface soil property relating to soil gas diffusion and the gas concentration profile. Flux estimations did not differ statistically between the exponential and nonlinear methods for either gas at any site, because both of those regression methods were based on diffusion theory. However, the flux values estimated by linear regression were significantly different from those estimated by the other two methods for both CH4 and CO2 at the deciduous forest site and for CO 2 at the coniferous forest site. Shortening the chamber deployment period improved the linearity of the curve, but did not completely eliminate the error. Our results suggest that linear regression is not a good model of the change in headspace concentration with time. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing weight of agricultural machines exacerbates the risk of subsoil compaction, a condition believed to be persistent and difficult to alleviate by soil tillage and natural loosening processes. However, experimental data on the persistency of subsoil compaction effects on soil pore functioning are scarce. This study evaluated and quantified persistent effects of subsoil compaction on soil pore structure and gas transport processes using intact cores taken at 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9m depth from a loamy soil in a compaction experiment in southern Sweden (Brahmehem Farm). The treatments included four repeated wheelings with {\~{}}10Mg wheel loads. Water retention characteristics (WRC), air permeability (k a) and gas diffusivity (D s/D o) were measured. A dual-porosity model fitted the WRC well, and there was a reduction in the volume of macropores {\textgreater}30$\mu$m in compacted compared with control soil for all soil depths. Averaged for all sampling depths and also for some individual depths, both k a and D s/D o were significantly reduced by compaction. Gas transport measurements showed that the experimental soil was poorly aerated, with local anoxic conditions at water regimes around field capacity in all plots and depths, but with significantly higher percentage anoxia in compacted soil. Our main findings were that: (1) commonly used agricultural machinery can compact the soil to 0.9m depth, (2) the effect may persist for at least 14 years, and (3) important soil functions are affected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The application of the eddy covariance flux method to measure fluxes of trace gas and energy between ecosystems and the atmosphere has exploded over the past 25 years. This opinion paper provides a perspective on the contributions and future opportunities of the eddy covariance method. First, the paper discusses the pros and cons of this method relative to other methods used to measure the exchange of trace gases between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Second, it discusses how the use of eddy covariance method has grown and evolved. Today, more than 400 flux measurement sites are operating world-wide and the duration of the time series exceed a decade at dozens of sites. Networks of tower sites now enable scientists to ask scientific questions related to climatic and ecological gradients, disturbance, changes in land use, and management. The paper ends with discussions on where the field of flux measurement is heading. Topics discussed include role of open access data sharing and data mining, in this new era of big data, and opportunities new sensors that measure a variety of trace gases, like volatile organic carbon compounds, methane and nitrous oxide, and aerosols, may yield.},

abstract = {In order to better predict soil sinks of methane, we need to examine soil methane flux patterns and responses to altered soil moisture regimes. Estimates of the global atmospheric CH4budget must also account for fluxes in the vast boreal region. We measured methane fluxes into the soil surface, methane concentrations, water content, and temperature in the soil profile in two interior Alaskan forests, over two growing seasons. At each site, a 0.10 ha rain-shelter limited summer precipitation from entering the soil. Limiting summer precipitation at the upland site generally increased that site's soil uptake of methane. Average rates of soil methane uptake among upland plots ranged from 0.10 to 0.95 mg m-2day-1. At the floodplain site, limiting precipitation decreased the soil methane uptake of that site, and the rates here ranged from -0.02 to 0.57 mg m-2day-1. Using soil profile methane concentrations, we calculated CH4fluxes using Fick's Law. Our inability to precisely measure the concentration gradient across the soil surface resulted in calculated flux estimates that more likely represent fluxes within the soil profile. Methane sources and sinks in the soil profile also confounded the comparison of measured and calculated fluxes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This study has examined the ability of a commercial, miniature soil moisture probe to measure water content within the leaf litter layer found on the floor below a deciduous forest site in Oak Ridge, eastern Tennessee. With its small size and high moisture sensitivity, this probe provides a potential opportunity for monitoring the water content beneath complex vegetation systems within the soil-air interface normally characterized by a large spatial variability and small magnitude of energy, water and carbon fluxes. With its low-cost and low-power, many of these probes can be easily deployed at a much lower cost than the single traditional soil moisture probe that is usually used for monitoring local-site soil moisture and is unsuitable for litter wetness. Miniature probe measurements of litter moisture were compared with gravimetric measurements from litter sample baskets positioned across the forest floor and the change in the magnitude of the probe output correlated linearly to the water content of the litter. Gravimetric measurements of the litter water content ranged from 1 to 3g(H2O)g-1(litter dry weight), and hourly values varied with precipitation, radiation, and wind speed. Measurements of the litter and soil water content were incorporated into empirical models adopted from the literature for estimating the litter and soil components of the CO2flux. The comparison between the modeled and the measured hourly CO2flux on the forest floor produced root means square differences (RMSD) of about 1.11 and 1.32 umol m-2s-1for estimates with and without litter layer, respectively, and about 25{\%} of the forest floor CO2flux was due to direct contributions from the litter layer. The results of the study indicate that the probes performed well in a complex forest environment and can be used to help evaluate the water, energy and CO2fluxes on the soil surface inside a variety of vegetation stands. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

For this purpose, intact soil cores were incubated in the laboratory under varying soil moisture and temperature levels according to field conditions in the Xilin River catchment. CO2and CH4fluxes were determined approximately daily, while soil CH4gas profile measurements at four soil depths (5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm) were measured at least twice per week. Land use/cover generally had a substantial influence on CO2and CH4fluxes, with the order of CH4uptake and CO2emission rates of the different land use/cover types being TS ≥ MM ≥ SD {\textgreater} ML and MM {\textgreater} TS ≥ SD {\textgreater} ML, respectively. Significant negative soil moisture and positive temperature effects on CH4uptake were found for most soils, except for ML soils. As for CO2flux, both significant positive soil moisture and temperature effects were observed for all the soils. The combination of soil moisture and temperature could explain a large part of the variation in CO2(up to 87{\%}) and CH4(up to 68{\%}) fluxes for most soils. Drying/re-wetting showed a pronounced stimulation of CO2emissions for all the soils -with maximum fluxes of 28.4 ± 2.6, 50.0 ± 5.7, 81.9 ± 2.7 and 10.6 ± 1.2 mg C m-2 h-1for TS, SD, MM and ML soils, respectively-but had a negligible effect on CH4fluxes (TS: -3.6 ± 0.2; SD: 1.0 ± 0.9; MM: -4.1 ± 1.3; ML: -5.6 ± 0.8; all fluxes in $\mu$g C m-2 h-1). Enhanced CO2emission and CH4oxidation were observed for all soils during thawing periods. In addition, a very distinct vertical gradient of soil air CH4concentrations was observed for all land use/cover types, with gradually decreasing CH4concentrations down to 30 cm soil depth. The changes in soil air CH4concentration gradients were in accordance with the changes of CH4fluxes during the entire incubation experiment for all soils. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Methane (CH4) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Although forest and grassland soils generally consume atmospheric CH4, the quantities and spatiotemporal changes in CH4uptake remain largely uncertain for these ecosystems at the global scale. In this study, we developed an empirical model to estimate the CH4uptake in global forest and grassland soils during the period 1981–2010. We estimated that the mean values of CH4uptake were 9.16 (± 3.84) Tg yr− 1in forest soils and 3.73 (± 1.41) Tg yr− 1in grassland soils during the study period. Tropical forest and grassland soils were determined to be the largest CH4sink, contributing 58{\%} to the global total. During the 30-year period, the CH4uptake in cool temperate dry and warm temperate dry soils and in polar/boreal grassland soils increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) at rates of 0.30–2.95 Gg yr− 1owing mainly to increases in mean temperatures. However, the uptake decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) in tropical dry grassland soils, at 1.22 Gg yr− 1, owing mainly to increases in precipitation. Ultimately, our simulation indicated that the global CH4uptake by forest and grassland soils increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) at rates of 4.67 Gg yr− 1and 2.98 Gg yr− 1, respectively, during the period 1981–2010. The trend of increasing sinks from forest and grassland and its relationship with temperature and precipitation variability imply that forest and grassland CH4sinks will play a positive role in climate change mitigation in the future.},

abstract = {Measurements of soil fluxes of hydrothermal gases, with special emphasis on C6H6, as well as chemical composition of mono-aromatic compounds in fumaroles and air, were carried out in April 2012 at the Solfatara crater (Campi Flegrei, Southern Italy) to investigate the distribution and behavior of these species as they migrate through the soil from their deep source to the atmosphere. Soil fluxes of CO2, CH4and C6H6exhibit good spatial correlation, suggesting that diffuse degassing is mainly controlled by local fractures. The calculated total output of diffuse C6H6from Solfatara is 0.10kgday-1, whereas fluxes of CO2and CH4are 79×103and 1.04kgday-1, respectively. A comparison between soil gas fluxes and fumarole composition reveals that within the crater soil CH4is significantly affected by oxidation processes, which are more efficient for low gas fluxes, being dependent on the residence time of the uprising hydrothermal gases at shallow depth. Benzene degradation, mainly proceeding through oxidation via benzoate, seems to be strongly controlled by the presence of a shallow SO42--rich aquifer located in the central and southwestern sectors of the crater, suggesting that the process is particularly efficient when SO42- acts as terminal electron acceptor (SO4reduction). Relatively high C6H6/C7H8ratios, typical of hydrothermal fluids, were measured in air close to the main fumarolic field of Solfatara crater. Here, C6H6concentrations, whose detection limit is {\~{}}0.1$\mu$gm-3, are more than one order of magnitude higher than the limit value for ambient air (5$\mu$gm-3). This suggests that hydrothermal fluids have a strong impact on air quality in the immediate surroundings of the fumarolic vents. Significant concentrations of endogenous mono-aromatics were also detected in air samples collected from the northern and western sides of the crater, where these gas compounds are mostly fed by diffuse degassing through the crater bottom soil. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25-30{\{}ring operator{\}}C per kilometer depth, howeverin active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150{\{}ring operator{\}}C per kilometer depthcan be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hotwater is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles areevidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling anddrying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper wereview the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from thetraditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirectdetection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat luxes,geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to publishedremote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions,mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from theLa Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between varioussurface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute toexploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached fullmaturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework.A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and thepresent contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number ofquestion lines: 'how reproducible are remote sensing products', 'can long term monitoring of geothermalsystems be achieved' and 'do surface manifestations link to subsurface features'? {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The key element in the characterization, assessment and development of geothermal energy systems is the resource type. Throughout the past 30 years many resource type schemes and definitions were published, based on temperature and thermodynamic properties. An alternative possibility to cataloging geothermal energy systems is by their geologic characteristics, referred to as geothermal plays. Applied to worldwide case studies, a new catalog is developed based on the effects of geological controls and structural plate tectonic positions on thermal regime and heat flow, hydrogeologic regime, fluid dynamics, fluid chemistry, faults and fractures, stress regime, and lithological sequence. Understanding geologic controls, especially of geothermal plays without surface expression, allows the comparison with hydrocarbon reservoirs through their ratio of porosity and permeability. This analog has implications on site-specific, first class exploration strategies and reservoir improvement through technologies specifically suitable for unconventional sustainable energy reservoirs. This article aims to introduce geothermal plays to a wide geoscientific community and to initiate a geologically based cataloging of geothermal resources. With this new catalog of geothermal plays, it will be ultimately possible to transfer lessons learned not only within one specific catalog type, but also technology from geothermal plays to unconventional hydrocarbon plays and vice versa. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {Detailed surveys of diffuse CO2flux, soil temperature, thermal gradients, and sampling of high-T fumaroles were carried out in the Favare area and Lake Specchio di Venere on Pantelleria Island. Spatial patterns of diffuse CO2emissions in the Favare area reflect structural discontinuities (faults, fractures or cracks in the soil) associated with the volcano-tectonic structures of the young Monastero Caldera (NNE-SSW to NE-SW trending). The estimated diffuse CO2output from two adjacent sites in the Favare area ({\~{}}93,000m2) is 7.8td-1(equivalent to 2.62kta-1), whereas that from the west shore of the lake (450m2) is 0.041td-1(or 0.015kta-1). The extrapolation of diffuse CO2fluxes across the entire altered area of Favare suggests that CO2emissions are {\~{}}19.3td-1. The diffuse CO2flux correlates with shallow soil temperatures, indicating a similar source for both the heat and volatiles from the underlying geothermal reservoir. Gas equilibria applied to fumarolic effluents define P-T conditions for this reservoir at 2-6bar and 120-160°C, in good agreement with measurements from exploratory wells in these areas (e.g., 135°C at a depth of 290m). Using the CO2flux as a tracer for steam output, and consequently for heat flow, the calculated thermal energy for the shallow reservoir is 10-12MW; this represents the minimum geothermal potential of the reservoir on Pantelleria island. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Areas with increased gas emissions can be indicative of major upflow zones from the reservoir through deep-reaching, permeable fault zones. These fault zones may act as preferential target areas for geothermal production drillings. In this study it is successfully demonstrated that diffuse degassing measurements can be used for the detection and characterization of permeable structural elements. The combination of following techniques has been applied at the Brady's geothermal system in the Basin-and-Range Province (Nevada, USA): accumulation chamber method for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide measurements, alpha-spectroscopic measurements of radon and thoron activity concentrations, and gamma-spectroscopic measurements of selected nuclides.},

abstract = {High carbon isotope values ($\delta$13CCH4{\textgreater} −40‰) have widely been used as evidence that methane in alkaline rock-hosted fluids was formed abiotically, particularly in serpentinizing systems. However, isotope fractionation during microbial methanogenesis is relatively understudied at high pH. We isolated a hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium sp. from hyperalkaline subsurface fluids in the Samail ophiolite to assess how carbon and hydrogen isotope values of CH4varied depending upon pH and carbonate mineral source (NaHCO3or CaCO3). The hydrogen isotope fractionation $\alpha$H20/CH4(1.46–1.66) did not vary across pH. In contrast, the expressed carbon isotope fractionation, $\alpha$CO2/CH4, ranged from 1.028 to 1.089. Carbon isotope fractionation increased with pH, reaching a maximum13C depletion of −85‰. However, the13C depletion significantly diminished at pH ≥ 9 for CaCO3-amended experiments, generating $\delta$13CCH4as high as −28‰. To evaluate the large variability in $\delta$13CCH4, we developed a steady-state model to assess how the rates of carbonate dissolution, cellular uptake of CO2and irreversible CH4production can affect the net isotope fractionation during methanogenesis. Methanobacterium sp. can produce highly depleted $\delta$13CCH4in simulated alkaline serpentinizing fluids when dissolved inorganic carbon levels are high and methanogenesis rates are slow. However, small carbon isotope fractionation occurs when rates of carbonate dissolution are slower than cellular uptake, leading to relatively high $\delta$13CCH4values ({\textgreater}∼−35‰) that are traditionally interpreted to be purely “abiotic”. Thus, microbial CH4can be produced in carbon-limited mafic and ultramafic rock-hosted environments on Earth and potentially other planetary bodies, but it may be difficult to isotopically identify biogenic methane when mineral carbonates are the dominant carbon source.},

I fit the synthetic data using two different starting models to demonstrate the sensitivity of the gradient method used to solve the non-linear inverse to the starting model and the necessity of inspecting the final model to avoid spurious results.

abstract = {A new geothermometer (TCO2 Flux) is proposed based on soil diffuse CO2flux and shallow temperature measurements made on areas of steam heated, thermally altered ground above active geothermal systems. This CO2flux geothermometer is based on a previously reported CO2geothermometer that was designed for use with fumarole analysis. The new geothermometer provides a valuable additional exploration tool for estimating subsurface temperatures in high-temperature geothermal systems. Mean TCO2 Fluxestimates fall within the range of deep drill hole temperatures at Wairakei (New Zealand), Tauhara (New Zealand), Rotokawa (New Zealand), Ohaaki (New Zealand), Reykjanes (Iceland) and Copahue (Argentina). The spatial distribution of geothermometry estimates is consistent with the location of major upflow zones previously reported at the Wairakei and Rotokawa geothermal systems. TCO2 Fluxwas also evaluated at White Island (New Zealand) and Reporoa (New Zealand), where limited sub-surface data exists. Mode TCO2 Fluxat White Island is high (320 °C), the highest of the systems considered in this study. However, the geothermometer relies on mineral–water equilibrium in neutral pH reservoir fluids, and would not be reliable in such an active and acidic environment. Mean TCO2 Fluxat Reporoa (310 °C) is high, which indicates Reporoa has a separate upflow from the nearby Waiotapu geothermal system; an outflow from Waiotapu would not be expected to have such high temperature.},

abstract = {The chemical and isotopic composition of fumarolic gases emitted from Nisyros Volcano, Greece, and of a single gas sample from Vesuvio, Italy, was investigated in order to determine the origin of methane (CH4) within two subduction-related magmatic-hydrothermal environments. Apparent temperatures derived from carbon isotope partitioning between CH4and CO2of around 340°C for Nisyros and 470°C for Vesuvio correlate well with aquifer temperatures as measured directly and/or inferred from compositional data using the H2O-H2-CO2-CO-CH4geothermometer. Thermodynamic modeling reveals chemical equilibrium between CH4, CO2and H2O implying that carbon isotope partitioning between CO2and CH4in both systems is controlled by aquifer temperature. N2/3He and CH4/3He ratios of Nisyros fumarolic gases are unusually low for subduction zone gases and correspond to those of midoceanic ridge environments. Accordingly, CH4may have been primarily generated through the reduction of CO2by H2in the absence of any organic matter following a Fischer-Tropsch-type reaction. However, primary occurrence of minor amounts of thermogenic CH4and subsequent re-equilibration with co-existing CO2cannot be ruled out entirely. CO2/3He ratios and $\delta$13CCO2values imply that the evolved CO2either derives from a metasomatized mantle or is a mixture between two components, one outgassing from an unaltered mantle and the other released by thermal breakdown of marine carbonates. The latter may contain traces of organic matter possibly decomposing to CH4during thermometamorphism. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

Any eventual supereruption could devastate global human populations, so these systems must be carefully scrutinized. Insight into dormant but restless calderas can be gained by monitoring their output of heat and gas. At Yellowstone, the large thermal and CO2 fluxes require massive input of basaltic magma, which continues to invade the lower to mid-crust, sustains the overlying high-silica magma reservoir, and may result in volcanic hazard for millennia to come. The high flux of CO2 may contribute to the measured deformation of the caldera floor and can also modify the pressure, thermal, and chemical signals emitted from the magma. In order to recognize precursors to eruption, we must scrutinize the varied signals emerging from restless calderas with the goal of discriminating magmatic, hydrothermal, and hybrid phenomena.},

abstract = {Mathematical modeling is used in this study to assess how tectonic movement of fault blocks and fault permeability influence the present-day and paleohydrogeology of the Rio Grande Rift near Socorro, New Mexico. Our analysis focuses on active and ancient groundwater flow patterns and hot spring development within the southern La Jencia and Socorro subbasins. The best agreement between model results and present-day and paleoheat flow data was achieved by representing faults as passive surfaces and incorporating 2 km of moderately permeable (10-14.0 m2) fractured crystalline rocks into the hydrogeologic model. Quantitative results indicate that changes in groundwater flow patterns across the basin are primarily generated by the truncation/reconnection of aquifers and confining units. Calculated flow patterns help to explain the annealing of apatite fission tracks within Eocene Baca Formation clasts to the east of Socorro, potassium metasomatism mass balance constraints within Oligocene volcanics and overlying Santa Fe Group deposits, and the timing of barite/fluorite ore mineralization within the Gonzales prospect on the eastern edge of the Rio Grande Rift. We estimate that about 5{\%} of mountain front recharge penetrates to a depth of 2.8 km below the sedimentary pile. This may have implications for water resource planners who have historically focused on groundwater resource development within the shallow alluvial deposits along the Rio Grande Rift valley.},

abstract = {Discrepancies among previous models of the geometry of the Albuquerque Basin motivated us to develop a new model using a comprehensive approach. Capitalizing on a natural separation between the densities of mainly Neogene basin fi ll (Santa Fe Group) and those of older rocks, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) geophysical model of syn-rift basin-fi ll thickness that incorporates well data, seismicrefl ection data, geologic cross sections, and other geophysical data in a constrained gravity inversion. Although the resulting model does not show structures directly, it elucidates important aspects of basin geometry. The main features are three, 3–5-kmdeep, interconnected structural depressions, which increase in size, complexity, and segmentation from north to south: the Santo Domingo, Calabacillas, and Belen subbasins. The increase in segmentation and complexity may refl ect a transition of the Rio Grande rift from well-defi ned structural depressions in the north to multiple, segmented basins within a broader region of crustal extension to the south. The modeled geometry of the subbasins and their connections differs from a widely accepted structural model based primarily on seismic-refl ection interpretations. Key elements of the previous model are an east-tilted half-graben block on the north separated from a west-tilted half-graben block on the south by a southwest-trending, scissorlike transfer zone. Instead, we fi nd multiple subbasins with predominantly easterly tilts for much of the Albuquerque Basin, a restricted region of westward tilting in the southwestern part of the basin, and a northwesterly trending antiform dividing subbasins in the center of the basin instead of a major scissor-like transfer zone. The overall eastward tilt indicated by the 3D geophysical model generally conforms to satisstratal tilts observed for the syn-rift succession, implying a prolonged eastward tilting of the basin during Miocene time. An extensive north-south synform in the central part of the Belen subbasin suggests a possible path for the ancestral Rio Grande during late Miocene or early Pliocene time. Variations in rift-fi ll thickness correspond to pre-rift structures in several places, suggesting that a better understanding of pre-rift history may shed light on debates about structural inheritance within the rift.},

abstract = {Calcite-filled extension veins and shear fractures are preserved in numerous travertine deposits along the western margin of the Albuquerque Basin of the Rio Grande rift. Calcite veins are banded and show geometries suggesting incremental cracking and calcite precipitation. U-series and 234U model ages from calcite infillings indicate that vein formation was active in the Quaternary, from ca. 2 Ma to ca. 250 ka. Vein orientations are systematic within each deposit and record a dominant extension direction that was horizontal and varied from E-W to NW-SE, consistent with both the regional finite extensional strain in the rift and with the global positioning system (GPS)–constrained deformation field. Three sites contain three orthogonal vein sets that crosscut one another nonsystematically, suggesting alternating times of: (1) regional E-W horizontal extension (dominant), (2) alternating N-S and E-W vertical veins that suggest vertical s1 and s2 » s3, and (3) horizontal veins that are interpreted to reflect times of highest pore fluid pressures and subequal principal stresses. One site contains conjugate normal faults that also record the dominant E-W extensional tectonic stress. Quaternary extensional strain rates calculated from vein opening for three locations range from 3.2 ± 1.4 × 10–16 s–1 to 3.2 × 10-15 ± 2.7 × 10–16 s–1, which are up to ∼40 times higher than the long-term (Oligocene–Holocene) finite strain rates calculated for different basins of the Rio Grande rift (8.5 × 10–17 to 4.5 × 10–16 s–1), and up to ∼100 times higher than modern strain rates measured by GPS data (3.9 × 10-17 ± 6.3 × 10–18 to 4.4 × 10-17 ± 6.3 × 10–18 s–1). These high Quaternary rates are comparable to modern strain rates measured in the Basin and Range Province and East African Rift. Thus, this paper documents persistent E-W regional extension through the Quaternary in the Rio Grande rift that bridges geologic, paleoseismic, and GPS rates. Anomalously high strain rates in the Quaternary were facilitated by ascent of travertine-depositing CO2-rich waters along rift-bounding normal faults, leading to locally very high stain accumulations. These sites also provide examples of natural leakage of deeply sourced CO2 interacting with regional tectonism, and they emphasize that rift maturation is a highly dynamic process, both spatially and temporally.},

abstract = {Several decades of focused studies on the Valles–Toledo caldera complex and the Jemez Mountains in northern New Mexico have brought about new understanding of the relations of stratigraphic units that record the complex's evolution. We present here a revision of the formal stratigraphic nomenclature for the Quaternary Tewa Group, an established stratigraphic unit that includes the volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits of the caldera complex. We propose 11 completely new units of member rank, with descriptions of lithology, contact relations, distribution, and type areas. These new members are parts of the Bandelier Tuff, Cerro Toledo, and Valles Rhyolite Formations, and serve to depict the magmatic and geomorphic evolution of the area during and following each of two major caldera-forming episodes. With results from mapping efforts in the Jemez Mountains revealing the broad implications and interrelations of some established units, we redefine one formation (Cerro Toledo Rhyolite) and demote three formal members (El Cajete, Battleship Rock, and Banco Bonito) to bed or flow rank. Because it has been shown repeatedly in published works that one formation (Cerro Rubio Quartz Latite) was originally defined based on erroneous relations, we propose its formal abandonment. Additionally, we propose formal abandonment of one established member (Valle Grande Member of the Valles Rhyolite) because of lack of utility and widespread disuse. Our proposed revisions embody the practices of geologic mappers, and serve to better clarify relations of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks through the evolution of the Valles–Toledo caldera complex. The new formal stratigraphy that we propose will provide a flexible but robust framework for on-going and future research in the Valles–Toledo caldera complex.},

abstract = {This study focused on the geochemical and isotopic features of thermal fluids discharged from five zones located in the high altitude Puna plateau (Jujuy Province between S 22°20′–23°20′ and W 66°–67°), i.e. Granada, Vilama, Pairique, Coranzul{\'{i}} and Olaroz. Partially mature waters with a Na+-Cl−composition were recognized in all the investigated zones, suggesting that a deep hydrothermal reservoir hosted within the Paleozoic crystalline basement represents the main hydrothermal fluid source. The hydrothermal reservoirs are mainly recharged by meteoric water, although based on the $\delta$18O-H2O and $\delta$D-H2O values, some contribution of andesitic water cannot be completely ruled out. Regional S-oriented faulting systems, which generated a horst and graben tectonics, and NE-, NW- and WE-oriented transverse structures, likely act as preferentially uprising pathways for the deep-originated fluids, as also supported by the Rc/Ra values (up to 1.39) indicating the occurrence of significant amounts of mantle He (up to 16{\%}). Carbon dioxide, the most abundant compound in the gas phase associated with the thermal waters, mostly originated from a crustal source, although the occurrence of CO2from a mantle source, contaminated by organic-rich material due to the subduction process, is also possible. Relatively small and cold Na+-HCO3−-type aquifers were produced by the interaction between meteoric water and Cretaceous, Palaeogene to Miocene sediments. Dissolution of evaporitic surficial deposits strongly affected the chemistry of the thermal springs in the peripheral zones of the study area. Geothermometry in the Na-K-Ca-Mg system suggested equilibrium temperatures up to 200 °C for the deep aquifer, whereas lower temperatures (from 105 to 155 °C) were inferred by applying the H2geothermometer, likely due to re-equilibrium processes during the thermal fluid uprising within relatively shallow Na-HCO3aquifers. The great depth of the geothermal resource (possibly {\textgreater} 5000 m b.g.l.) is likely preventing further studies aimed to evaluate possible exploitation, although the occurrence of Li- and Ba-rich deposits associated may attract financial investments, giving a pulse for the development of this remote region.},

abstract = {The Domuyo volcanic complex (Neuqu{\"{i}}¿½n Province, Argentina) hosts one of the most promising geothermal systems of Patagonia, giving rise to thermal manifestations discharging hot and Cl−-rich fluids. This study reports a complete geochemical dataset of gas and water samples collected in three years (2013, 2014 and 2015) from the main fluid discharges of this area. The chemical and isotopic composition ($\delta$D-H2O and $\delta$18O-H2O) of waters indicates that rainwater and snow melting are the primary recharge of a hydrothermal reservoir located at relative shallow depth (400–600 m) possibly connected to a second deeper (2–3 km) reservoir. Reactive magmatic gases are completely scrubbed by the hydrothermal aquifer(s), whereas interaction of meteoric waters at the surface causes a significant air contamination and dilution of the fluid discharges located along the creeks at the foothill of the Cerro Domuyo edifice. Thermal discharges located at relatively high altitude ({\~{}} 3150 m a.s.l.), namely Bramadora, are less affected by this process, as also shown by their relatively high R/Ra values (up to 6.91) pointing to the occurrence of an actively degassing magma batch located at an unknown depth. Gas and solute geothermometry suggests equilibrium temperatures up to 220–240 {\"{i}}¿½C likely referred to the shallower hydrothermal reservoir. These results, confirming the promising indications of the preliminary surveys carried out in the 1980′s, provide useful information for a reliable estimation of the geothermal potential of this extinct volcanic system, although a detailed geophysical measurements is required for the correct estimation of depth and dimensions of the fluid reservoir(s).},

abstract = {One of the primary indicators of volcanic unrest at Mammoth Mountain is diffuse emission of magmatic CO2, which can effectively track this unrest if its variability in space and time and relationship to near-surface meteorological and hydrologic phenomena versus those occurring at depth beneath the mountain are understood. In June-October 2013, we conducted accumulation chamber soil CO2flux surveys and made half-hourly CO2flux measurements with automated eddy covariance and accumulation chamber (auto-chamber) instrumentation at the largest area of diffuse CO2degassing on Mammoth Mountain (Horseshoe Lake tree kill; HLTK). Estimated CO2emission rates for HLTK based on 20 June, 30 July, and 24-25 October soil CO2flux surveys were 165, 172, and 231td-1, respectively. The average (June-October) CO2emission rate estimated for this area was 123td-1based on an inversion of 4527 eddy covariance CO2flux measurements and corresponding modeled source weight functions. Average daily eddy covariance and auto-chamber CO2fluxes consistently declined over the four-month observation time. Wavelet analysis of auto-chamber CO2flux and environmental parameter time series was used to evaluate the periodicity of, and local correlation between these variables in time-frequency space. Overall, CO2emissions at HLTK were highly dynamic, displaying short-term (hourly to weekly) temporal variability related to meteorological and hydrologic changes, as well as long-term (monthly to multi-year) variations related to migration of CO2-rich magmatic fluids beneath the volcano. Accumulation chamber soil CO2flux surveys were also conducted in the four additional areas of diffuse CO2degassing on Mammoth Mountain in July-August 2013. Summing CO2emission rates for all five areas yielded a total for the mountain of 311td-1, which may suggest that emissions returned to 1998-2009 levels, following an increase from 2009 to 2011. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {We investigated the geochemical features of the fluids circulating over the Amik Basin (SE Turkey-Syria border), which is crossed by the Northern extension of the DSF (Dead Sea Fault) and represents the boundary area of three tectonic plates (Anatolian, Arabian and African plates). We collected 34 water samples (thermal and cold from natural springs and boreholes) as well as 8 gas samples (bubbling and gas seepage) besides the gases dissolved in the sampled waters. The results show that the dissolved gas phase is a mixture of shallow (atmospheric) and deep components either of mantle and crustal origin. Coherently the sampled waters are variable mixtures of shallow and deep ground waters, the latter being characterised by higher salinity and longer residence times. The deep groundwaters (from boreholes deeper than 1000m) have a CH4-dominated dissolved gas phase related to the presence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The very unique tectonic setting of the area includes the presence of an ophiolitic block outcropping in the westernmost area on the African Plate, as well as basalts located to the North and East on the Arabic Plate.The diffuse presence of CO2-enriched gases, although diluted by the huge groundwater circulation, testifies a regional degassing activity. Fluids circulating over the ophiolitic block are marked by H2-dominated gases with abiogenic methane and high-pH waters. The measured3He/4He isotopic ratios display contributions from both crustal and mantle-derived sources over both sides of the DSF. Although the serpentinization process is generally independent from mantle-type contribution, the recorded helium isotopic ratios highlight variable contents of mantle-derived fluids. Due to the absence of recent volcanism over the western side of the basin (African Plate), we argue that CO2-rich volatiles carrying mantle-type helium and enriched in heavy carbon, are degassed by deep-rooted regional faults rather than from volcanic sources.},

abstract = {This study presents the first geochemical data of fluid discharges collected from February 2010 to March 2015 from the Planch{\'{o}}n-Peteroa-Azufre Volcanic Complex (PPAVC), located in the Transitional Southern Volcanic Zone (TSVZ) at the border between Argentina and Chile. During the study period, from January 2010 to July 2011, Peteroa volcano experienced phreatic to phreatomagmatic eruption possibly related to the devastating Maule earthquake occurred on February 27, 2010. The compositional dataset includes low temperature (from 43.2 to 102 °C) gas discharges from (i) the summit of Peteroa volcano and (ii) the SE flank of Azufre volcano, both marked by a significant magmatic fluid contribution, as well as bubbling gases located at the foothill of the Peteroa volcanic edifice, which showed a chemical signature typical of hydrothermal fluids. In 2012, strong compositional changes affected the Peteroa gases from the summit area: the acidic gas species, especially SO2, increased, suggesting an input of fluids from magma degassing. Nevertheless, the R/Ra and $\delta$13C-CO2values decreased, which would imply an enhanced contribution from a meteoric-hydrothermal source. In 2014-2015, the chemical and isotopic compositions of the 2010-2011 gases were partially restored. The anomalous decoupling between the chemical and the isotopic parameters was tentatively interpreted as produced by degassing activity from a small batch of dacitic magma that in 2012 masked the compositional signature of the magmatic fluids released from a basaltic magma that dominated the gas chemistry in 2010-2011. This explanation reliably justifies the observed geochemical data, although the mechanisms leading to the change in time of the dominating magmatic fluid source are not clear. At this regard, a geophysical survey able to provide information on the location of the two magma batches could be useful to clarify the possible relationships between the compositional changes that affected the Peteroa fluid discharges and the 2010-2011 eruptive activity.},

Using a case study at the Brady's geothermal field in Nevada (USA), we demonstrate how permeable fractures can be identified and assessed by combining fault stress models with measurements of diffuse degassing and emanations at Earth's surface. Areas of maximum gas emissions and emanations correspond to fault segments with increased slip and dilation tendency, and represent a fingerprint of the geothermal system at depth. Thus, linking gas fluxes with fault stress models serves as a measure of the connectivity between surface and subsurface.},

abstract = {Many environmental scientists are analysing spatial data by geostatistical methods and interpolating from sparse sample data by kriging to make maps. They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We measured soil CO2flux in the representative hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), to better understand the volcano's dynamic nature, and to estimate its soil CO2degassing output. Results show that the average soil CO2fluxes obtained at Da-You-Keng (DYK), Geng-Tze-Ping (GTP), She-Haung-Ping (SHP), and Tatun Natural Park (TNP) were 128 g m-2d-1, 518 g m-2d-1, 420 g m-2d-1, and 25 g m-2d-1, respectively. The range is comparable to other active volcanic/hydrothermal areas in the world. Along with Liu-Huang-Ku (LHK), where the soil CO2flux is known, the total soil CO2output from measured areas is evaluated at 82 t d-1. Furthermore, a first total soil CO2output from the whole hydrothermal areas of the TVG is roughly estimated at 113 t d-1, which includes 15 t d-1mantle contribution. Considering the mantle-derived CO2flux and H2O/CO2ratio of fumarolic gas, thermal energy associated with the diffuse degassing at the TVG hydrothermal area is estimated at 8.2 MW. Carbon ($\delta$13C) and helium (3He/4He) isotopic ratios of soil samples of the studied areas ranged from -4.4 to -6.7‰, and 2.45 to 6.98 RA, respectively. The extent of air involvement in the soil-degassing system, as constrained by the helium and carbon isotopic compositions, provides essential information for depicting regional degassing features of the hydrothermal areas.},

abstract = {Copahue volcano is part of the Caviahue-Copahue Volcanic Complex (CCVC), which is located in the southwestern sector of the Caviahue volcano-tectonic depression (Argentina-Chile). This depression is a pull-apart basin accommodating stresses between the southern Liqui{\~{n}}e-Ofqui strike slip and the northern Copahue-Anti{\~{n}}ir compressive fault systems, in a back-arc setting with respect to the Southern Andean Volcanic Zone. In this study, we present chemical (inorganic and organic) and isotope compositions ($\delta$13C-CO2, $\delta$15N,3He/4He,40Ar/36Ar, $\delta$13C-CH4, $\delta$D-CH4, and $\delta$D-H2O and $\delta$18O-H2O) of fumaroles and bubbling gases of thermal springs located at the foot of Copahue volcano sampled in 2006, 2007 and 2012. Helium isotope ratios, the highest observed for a Southern American volcano (R/Raup to 7.94), indicate a non-classic arc-like setting, but rather an extensional regime subdued to asthenospheric thinning. $\delta$13C-CO2values (from -8.8‰ to -6.8‰ vs. V-PDB), $\delta$15N values (+5.3‰ to +5.5‰ vs. Air) and CO2/3He ratios (from 1.4 to 8.8×109) suggest that the magmatic source is significantly affected by contamination of subducted sediments. Gases discharged from the northern sector of the CCVC show contribution of3He-poor fluids likely permeating through local fault systems. Despite the clear mantle isotope signature in the CCVC gases, the acidic gas species have suffered scrubbing processes by a hydrothermal system mainly recharged by meteoric water. Gas geothermometry in the H2O-CO2-CH4-CO-H2system suggests that CO and H2re-equilibrate in a separated vapor phase at 200°-220°C. On the contrary, rock-fluid interactions controlling CO2, CH4production from Sabatier reaction and C3H8dehydrogenation seem to occur within the hydrothermal reservoir at temperatures ranging from 250° to 300°C. Fumarole gases sampled in 2006-2007 show relatively low N2/He and N2/Ar ratios and high R/Ravalues with respect to those measured in 2012. Such compositional and isotope variations were likely related to injection of mafic magma that likely triggered the 2000 eruption. Therefore, changes affecting the magmatic system had a delayed effect on the chemistry of the CCVC gases due to the presence of the hydrothermal reservoir. However, geochemical monitoring activities mainly focused on the behavior of inert gas compounds (N2and He), should be increased to investigate the mechanism at the origin of the unrest started in 2011. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The gas source is likely related to a relatively shallow geothermal reservoir containing a single vapor phase as also suggested by both the geochemical data from the 3 deep wells drilled in the 1980s and gas geoindicators applied to the fumarolic discharges. Gas equilibria within the H-C-O gas system indicate the presence of a large, probably unique, single phase vapor zone at 200-210°C feeding the hydrothermal manifestations of Las M{\'{a}}quinas, Las Maquinitas I and II and Termas de Copahue. A natural thermal release of 107MW was computed by using CO2as a tracer of the original vapor phase. The magmatic signature of the incondensable fumarolic gases, the wide expanse of the hydrothermal areas and the remarkable high amount of gas and heat released by fluid expulsion seem to be compatible with an active magmatic intrusion beneath this portion of the Caviahue caldera.},

This CO2flux geothermometer is based on a previously reported CO2geothermometer that was designed for use with fumarole analysis. The new geothermometer provides a valuable additional exploration tool for estimating subsurface temperatures in high-temperature geothermal systems. Mean TCO2 Fluxestimates fall within the range of deep drill hole temperatures at Wairakei (New Zealand), Tauhara (New Zealand), Rotokawa (New Zealand), Ohaaki (New Zealand), Reykjanes (Iceland) and Copahue (Argentina). The spatial distribution of geothermometry estimates is consistent with the location of major upflow zones previously reported at the Wairakei and Rotokawa geothermal systems. TCO2 Fluxwas also evaluated at White Island (New Zealand) and Reporoa (New Zealand), where limited sub-surface data exists. Mode TCO2 Fluxat White Island is high (320 °C), the highest of the systems considered in this study. However, the geothermometer relies on mineral–water equilibrium in neutral pH reservoir fluids, and would not be reliable in such an active and acidic environment. Mean TCO2 Fluxat Reporoa (310 °C) is high, which indicates Reporoa has a separate upflow from the nearby Waiotapu geothermal system; an outflow from Waiotapu would not be expected to have such high temperature.},

Here, using an inversion procedure, we show how assimilating snapshots of the volcanic SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} load derived from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) allows for reconstructing both the flux and altitude of the SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions with an hourly resolution.

As proof of concept, we study the 10 April 2011 eruption of the Etna volcano (Italy), which represents one of the few volcanoes instrumented on the ground for the continuous monitoring of SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} degassing. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We find that the SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} flux time-series retrieved from satellite imagery using the inverse scheme is in agreement with ground observations during ash-poor phases of the eruption. However, large discrepancies are observed during the ash-rich paroxysmal phase as a result of enhanced plume opacity affecting ground-based ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic retrievals. As a consequence, the SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission rate derived from the ground is underestimated by almost one order of magnitude. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Altitudes of the SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions predicted by the inverse scheme are validated against a RGB MODIS image capturing the near-source atmospheric pathways followed by Etna plumes, in combination with forward trajectories from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. At large distance from the source, modeled SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} altitudes are confronted with independent information on the volcanic cloud height. We find that the altitude predicted by the inverse scheme is in agreement with snapshots of the SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} height retrieved from recent algorithms exploiting the high spectral resolution of IASI. The validity of the modeled SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} altitude is further confirmed by the detection of a layer of particles at the same altitude by the spaceborne CALIOP LiDAR. Analysis of CALIOP color and depolarization ratios suggests that these particles consist of sulfate aerosols formed from precursory volcanic SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The reconstruction of emission altitude, through inversion procedures which assimilate volcanic SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} column amounts, requires specific meteorological conditions, especially sufficient wind shear so that gas parcels emitted at different altitudes follow distinct trajectories. We consequently explore the possibility and limits of assimilating in inverse schemes infrared (IR) imagery of the volcanic SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} cloud altitude which will render the inversion procedure independent of the wind shear prerequisite.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The chemistry of gases in thermal fluids from Iceland was studied in order to evaluate the sources and processes affecting volatile concentrations in volcanic geothermal systems at divergent plate boundaries. The fluids included vapor fumaroles and two-phase well discharges with temperatures of {\~{}} 100–340 °C. The vapor was dominated by H2O accounting for 62–100 mol{\%} and generally for {\textgreater} 99 mol{\%}, with CO2, H2S and H2being the dominant gases followed by N2, CH4, and Ar. Overall mineral-gas and gas-gas equilibria were not observed for the major gases, including CO2, H2S, H2and CH4within the geothermal reservoirs. Instead the system proved to be controlled by source(s) and their ratios and various metastable equilibria along a fluid-rock reaction progress with gas concentrations controlled by such metastable equilibria varying at particular temperatures as a functional extent of reaction. The concentrations of H2S and H2closely reflect mineral-fluid metastable equilibria, whereas CO2concentrations are controlled by the input of magma gas corresponding to {\textgreater} 0.1 to {\textless} 5{\%} mass input. With fluid ascent to the surface, boiling and condensation may occur, further changing the gas concentrations and hence surface fumaroles may not reflect the reservoir fluid characteristics but rather secondary processes.},

@article{Kieffer1984,
abstract = {Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, U.S.A., is a relatively isolated source of seismic noise and exhibits seismic behavior similar to that observed at many volcanoes, including "bubblequakes" that resemble B-type "earthquakes", harmonic tremor before and during eruptions, and periods of seismic quiet prior to eruptions. Although Old Faithful differs from volcanoes in that the conduit is continuously open, that rock-fracturing is not a process responsible for seismicity, and that the erupting fluid is inviscid H2O rather than viscous magma, there are also remarkable similarities in the problems of heat and mass recharge to the system, in the eruption dynamics, and in the seismicity. Water rises irregularly into the immediate reservoir of Old Faithful as recharge occurs, a fact that suggests that there are two enlarged storage regions: one between 18 and 22 m (the base of the immediate reservoir) and one between about 10 and 12 m depth. Transport of heat from hot water or steam entering at the base of the recharging water column into cooler overlying water occurs by migration of steam bubbles upward and their collapse in the cooler water, and by episodes of convective overturn. An eruption occurs when the temperature of the near-surface water exceeds the boiling point if the entire water column is sufficiently close to the boiling curve that the propagation of pressure-release waves (rarefactions) down the column can bring the liquid water onto the boiling curve. The process of conversion of the liquid water in the conduit at the onset of an eruption into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture takes on the order of 30 s. The seismicity is directly related to the sequence of filling and heating during the recharge cycle, and to the fluid mechanics of the eruption. Short (0.2-0.3 s), monochromatic, high-frequency events (20-60 Hz) resembling unsustained harmonic tremor and, in some instances, B-type volcanic earthquakes, occur when exploding or imploding bubbles of steam cause transient vibrations of the fluid column. The frequency of the events is determined by the length of the water column and the speed of sound of the fluid in the conduit when these events occur; damping is controlled by the characteristic and hydraulic impedances, which depend on the above parameters, as well as on the recharge rate of the fluid. Two periods of reduced seismicity (of a few tens of seconds to nearly a minute in duration) occur during the recharge cycle, apparently when the water rises rapidly through the narrow regions of the conduit, causing a sudden pressure increase that temporarily suppresses steam bubble formation. A period of decreased seismicity also precedes preplay or an eruption; this appears to be the time when rising steam bubbles move into a zone of boiling that is acoustically decoupled from the wall of the conduit because of the acoustic impedance mismatch between boiling water ($\rho$c∼ 103g cm-2s-1) and rock ($\rho$c∼ 3 × 105g cm2s-1). Sustained harmonic tremor occurs during the first one to one-and-a-half minutes of an eruption of Old Faithful, but is not detectable in the succeeding minutes of the eruption. The eruption tremor is caused by hydraulic transients propagating within a sublayer of unvesiculated water that underlies the erupting two-phase liquid-vapor mixture. The resonant frequencies of the fluid column decrease to about 1 Hz when all of the water in the conduit has been converted to a water-steam mixture. Surges are observed in the flow at this frequency, but the resonance has not been detected seismically, possibly because the two-phase erupting fluid is seismically decoupled from the rock on which seismometers are placed. If Old Faithful is an analogue for volcanic seismicity, this study shows that because the frequency of tremor depends on the acoustic properties of the fluid and on conduit dimensions, both properties must be considered in analysis of tremor in volcanic regions. Because magma sound speed can vary over nearly two orders of magnitude as it changes from an undersaturated liquid into a saturated two-phase mixture, tremor frequency might vary by this magnitude and very broad-band seismographs may be required if tremor is to be monitored as magma goes from an undersaturated liquid to a vesiculated froth. Cessation of fluid-induced seismicity may indicate that the processes that drive the transients cease, but it is also possible that the processes that drive the transients continue but the fluid properties change so that the fluid becomes acoustically decoupled from the rock on which seismometers are placed. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The rear-arc Laguna del Maule volcanic ﬁeld (LdM) in the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, 36 S, is among the most active latest Pleistocene–Holocene rhyolitic centers globally and has been inﬂating at a rate of{\textgreater} 20 cm a –1 since 2007. At least 50 eruptions during the last 26 kyr allow for a thorough interrogation of changes in the physical and chemical state of this large, 20 km diameter, silicic system. Trace element concentrations and Sr, Pb and Th isotope ratios indicate that the maﬁc precursors to the LdM rhyolites result from mixing between partial melts of garnet-bearing mantle and crust in Th-excess and partial melts of garnet-free crust in U-excess. The Th ratios of the LdM lavas are decoupled from the slab ﬂuid signature, similar to several recently studied frontal arc volcanic centers in the Southern Volcanic Zone. A narrow range of radiogenic isotope compositions and increasing isotopic homogeneity with differentiation indicate that silicic magma is generated by magma hybridization and crystallization in the upper crust with limited involvement of older, radiogenic material. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and 36 Cl ages reveal a wide footprint of silicic volcanism during the early post-glacial (25–19 ka) and Holocene (c. 8–2 ka) periods, but focused within a single eruptive center during the interim period. Subtle temporal variations in trace element compositions and two-oxide temperatures indicate that these eruptions, issued from vents distributed within a similar area, tapped at least two physically discrete rhyolite reservoirs. This compositional distinction favors punctuated extraction and ephemeral storage of the erupted magma batches. Frequent maﬁc recharge incubates this long-lived, growing shallow silicic magma reservoir above the granite eutectic, which favors magma interactions over rejuvenation of near- to sub-solidus silicic cumulates. A long-term rate of mass addition—extrapolated from surface deformation accumulated over the past decade—is comparable with those that have produced moderate- to largevolume caldera-forming eruptions elsewhere.},

abstract = {Multiphase and multicomponent fluid flow in the shallow continental crust plays a significant role in a variety of processes over a broad range of temperatures and pressures. The presence of dissolved gases in aqueous fluids reduces the liquid stability field toward lower temperatures and enhances the explosivity potential with respect to pure water. Therefore, in areas where magma is actively degassing into a hydrothermal system, gas-rich aqueous fluids can exert a major control on geothermal energy production, can be propellants in hazardous hydrothermal (phreatic) eruptions, and can modulate the dynamics of geyser eruptions. We collected pressurized samples of thermal water that preserved dissolved gases in conjunction with precise temperature measurements with depth in research well Y-7 (maximum depth of 70.1 m; casing to 31 m) and five thermal pools (maximum depth of 11.3 m) in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park, USA. Based on the dissolved gas concentrations, we demonstrate that CO2 mainly derived from magma and N2 from air-saturated meteoric water reduce the near-surface saturation temperature, consistent with some previous observations in geyser conduits. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the dissolved CO2 and N2 modulate the dynamics of geyser eruptions and are likely triggers of hydrothermal eruptions when recharged into shallow reservoirs at high concentrations. Therefore, monitoring changes in gas emission rate and composition in areas with neutral and alkaline chlorine thermal features could provide important information on the natural resources (geysers) and hazards (eruptions) in these areas.},

Here, we investigated how this gas release can be disrupted by the passage of seismic waves. We performed continuous soil CO2 flux measurements during the propagation of seismic vibrations in the range of 5 Hz to 200 Hz induced by a vibroseis truck. The CO2 flux was continuously recorded using the accumulation chamber method. The data show a temporary and drastic (up to two-fold) increase in CO2 flux exclusively during the vibrations, before returning to the initial flux values. These transient variations are interpreted as fluidization of the surficial granular layer that releases the stored gas. Similar degassing processes might occur at a larger scale during earthquakes, to cause temporary increases in the total gas outflow in volcanic or tectonic areas. Our findings are useful to better assess and monitor the potential hazard from sudden CO2 flux release during earthquakes as several cases of intoxication or death have already been related to volcanic degassing.},

1 | Introduction
- From prior research, we know that the gas fluxing from YNP has $\delta$13C-CH4 values between -59.2‰ and -23.4‰
- Moran and colleagues hypothesize that CH4 measurements from fumeroles would be between -40‰ and -30‰

- Moran et al believes that their data shows equilibriation of CH4 with both DIC and H2O at a temperature that indicates CH4 was formed at depth (deeper than the hydrothermal reservoir) and equilibration occured as the gas ascended through the column
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This would be similar to the theory mentioned in Horita (2001) and Panachi (1979) that states that the isotopic exchange is frozen in at depth 

2 | Sampling Methods and Analysis

- The carbon and hydrogen isotopes for methane were analyzed at University of California with an IRMS
- Higher order hydrocarbon data was measured using a GC-FID},

abstract = {A stratified adaptive sampling plan was designed to estimate CO2 degassing in Yellowstone National Park and was applied in the Mud Volcano thermal area. The stratified component of the sampling design focused effort in thermal areas and the adaptive component in high-flux regions, yet neither sampling technique biased the estimate of total degassing. Both diffuse soil fluxes (up to ∼30,000 g m−2d−1) and emission rates from thermal vents (up to 1.7×108 mol yr−1) were measured in thermal areas. Soil fluxes observed in most nonthermal regions were similar to values reported for conifer forests (≤ 15 g m−2 d−1). However, through adaptive sampling, high-flux vegetated sites were identified in Mud Volcano that likely would not have been found if sampling was focused in obvious thermal or altered regions. A simple model applied to flux measurements suggests that ∼40{\%} of the analyzed measurements were dominated by possible advective transport and ∼30{\%} by diffusive transport. Isotopic signatures of soil CO2 generally suggest a deep origin ($\delta$13C = −2.3 to 0.0) in thermal areas and biogenic origin ($\delta$13C = −20.5) in nonthermal, low-flux areas. Vent emissions accounted for ∼32–63{\%} of the total degassing observed at Mud Volcano (2.4 to 4.0×109 mol yr−1). The largest source of error in the estimation of total degassing (factor of ∼2) resulted because the population distribution of thermal feature emissions was indeterminate. Total CO2 emissions at Mud Volcano are comparable to other hydrothermal regions worldwide, suggesting that the Yellowstone volcanic system is likely a large contributor to global volcanic/metamoohic/hydrothermal (VMH) emissions. },

Simple random sampling is the most commonly used formal methodology, in which the probability that any unit is sampled is known. Generally, units to be sampled are selected using a random number generator so that each unit has an equal chance of selection. In stratified sampling, the sampling frame is partitioned so that similar observed variable measurements are in each stratum. Systematic sampling attempts to capture the full variability within an area by obtaining samples at some predetermined interval. Adaptive cluster sampling is a relatively new methodology that allows additional units to be sampled, based on preceding sampling observations. The systematic adaptive sampling method applies adaptive cluster sampling to a systematic design. Selecting an appropriate design requires an understanding of the variability in the parameter of interest as well as the spatial covariance structure. This paper addresses such critical issues as sampling density, number of samples to collect, and assessment of the dimensions of a subregion to be sampled. While many researchers use the sampling designs presented herein, it is possible that inappropriate estimating equations were used. Formulae required to calculate unbiased, precise estimators for each of the designs are presented. The collection of CO2 flux degassing measurements from the Mud Volcano area, Yellowstone during the 1997 field season is used as a case study to outline the logical steps in selecting a sampling design. Although the case study used a stratified adaptive cluster sampling design, simpler designs can be developed based on the theory presented herein. },

abstract = {Direct measurement of present day CH4 diffuse degassing from the soil represents an effective tool to better estimate the degassing rate of individual sources and to calibrate global Earth degassing estimates. While many data exist on CH4 emissions from ecosystems, agricultural soils and landfills, few estimates of CH4 emissions from volcanic-geothermal areas have been performed. The authors report results and discuss applications of accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CH4 and CO2 flux from Solfatara of Pozuoli (Naples), Vulcano Island and Poggio dell'Olivo (Viterbo) volcanic-geothermal areas, and the Palma Campania landfill (Naples). Volcanic-geothermal study areas are characterised by vent discharges of fluids with different CH4/CO2 ratios (from 4.7×10-5 to 7.5×10-5, 4.7×10-4 and 2.5×10-3 by weight, for Solfatara of Pozzuoli, Vulcano island, and Poggio dell'Olivo areas, respectively). Soil CH4 fluxes range from 0.003 to 48 g m-2 day-1 in the volcanic-geothermal areas and from 0.0021 to 936 g m-2 day-1 in the landfill, with high spatial variability observed in all areas. Using statistical methods different flux populations were distinguished (i.e. background soil gases and deeply derived gases) and the total gas emissions from study sites calculated. The results of this work show that CH4/CO2 ratios of deep fluids, fumarolic fluids in the case of the volcanic-geothermal environment and biogas in landfills, are roughly maintained in the gas phase diffusely degassed by the soil. Due to high spatial variability, a large number of flux measurements and appropriate statistical methods are needed to estimate total gas discharge from study areas. Furthermore, the simultaneous measurement of diffuse CH4 and CO2 fluxes represents a strong constraint for interpretative models of deep processes associated with soil degassing. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Unlike CO 2 , atmospheric methane concentrations are rising faster than at any time in the past two decades and, since 2014, are now approaching the most greenhouse-gas-intensive scenarios. The reasons for this renewed growth are still unclear, primarily because of uncertainties in the global methane budget. New analysis suggests that the recent rapid rise in global methane concentrations is predominantly biogenic-most likely from agriculture-with smaller contributions from fossil fuel use and possibly wetlands. Additional attention is urgently needed to quantify and reduce methane emissions. Methane mitigation offers rapid climate benefits and economic, health and agricultural co-benefits that are highly complementary to CO 2 mitigation.},

abstract = {A changing climate has the potential to mobilize soil carbon, shifting seasonally snow-covered, forested ecosystems from carbon sinks to sources. To determine the sensitivity of soil carbon fluxes to changes in temperature and moisture, we quantified seasonal and spatial variability of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes (N = 746) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachate (N = 260) in high-elevation, mixed conifer forests in Arizona and New Mexico. All sites have cold winters, warm summers, and bimodal soil moisture patterns associated with snowmelt and summer monsoon rainfall. We employed a state factor approach, quantifying how distal controls (parent material, regional climate, topography) interacted with proximal variability in soil temperature (−3 to 26 °C) and moisture (2–76 {\%}) to influence carbon effluxes. Carbon loss was dominated by CO2 flux (250–1220 g C m−2 year−1) rather than leached DOC (7.0–9.4 g C m−2 year−1). Significant differences in mean growing season CO2 flux were associated with parent material and aspect; differences appear to be mediated by how these distal controls influence primarily moisture and secondarily temperature. Across all sites, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) relying on moisture and temperature best described growing season CO2 fluxes (r2 = 0.63, p {\textless} 0.001). During winter, the MLR describing soil CO2 flux (r2 = 0.98, p {\textless} 0.001) relied on distal factors including snow cover, clay content, and bulk carbon, all factors that influence liquid water content. Our findings highlight the importance of state factors in controlling soil respiration primarily through influencing spatial and temporal heterogeneity in soil moisture.},

abstract = {During the process of exploring aqueous piperazine chemistry under simulated flue-gas scrubbing conditions, positive-ion electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) analyses of the resulting reaction mixtures in a triple quadrupole system revealed the presence of peaks at m/z 116 and 145, the putative N-nitroso derivatives of piperazine. Confirmation of the presence of these species in the reaction mixtures was achieved using collision-induced dissociation experiments. A purchased standard, together with in-house synthesised N-nitrosopiperazine standards (including N-nitroso derivatives derived from deuterium-labelled precursor materials), were used for this purpose. Across a small range of collision energies, large fluctuations in the abundance of the two major product ions of protonated N-nitrosopiperazine, m/z 86 and 85, were observed. Using B3LYP/6-311 + +G(d,p) computations, the potential energy surface was determined for loss of NO and [H,N,O]. At an activation energy slightly in excess of 1 eV, intramolecular isomerisation precedes loss of NO (m/z 86) via a 4,1 H-shift, and at activation energies between 2.1-2.3 eV, consecutive loss of NO and atomic hydrogen competes with the direct loss of nitrosyl hydride (m/z 85). It is recommended that any multiple reaction monitoring method for quantifying N-nitrosopiperazines at low collision energies use the sum of both transitions (m/z 116 ← 85, m/z 116 ← 86) to avoid errors that could be introduced by subtle changes in ES source conditions or collision voltages. This approach is adopted in an HPLC/MS/MS method used to monitor the degradation of N-nitrosopiperazine exposed to (i) broad-band UV light and (ii) heat typical of an amine regeneration (stripper) tower. The results reveal that aqueous N-nitrosopiperazine is thermally stable at 150°C but will degrade slowly upon exposure to UV light.},

abstract = {Methane emission by soils results from antagonistic but correlated microbial activities. Methane is produced in the anaerobic zones of submerged soils by methanogens and is oxidised into CO, by methanotrophs in the aerobic zones of wetland soils and in upland soils. Methanogens and methanotrophs are ubiquitous in soils where they remain viable under unfavourable conditions. Methane transfer from the soil to the atmosphere occurs mostly through the aerenchyma of aquatic plants, but also by diffusion and as bubbles escaping from wetland soils. Methane sources are mainly wetlands. However 60 to more than 90 {\%} of CH4 produced in the anaerobic zones of wetlands is reoxidised in their aerobic zones (rhizosphere and oxidised soil-water interface). Methane consumption occurs in most soils and exhibits a broad range of values. Highest consumption rates or potentials are observed in soils where methanogenesis is or has been effective and where CH, concentration is or has been much higher than in the atmosphere (ricefields, swamps, landfills, etc.). Aerobic soils consume atmospheric CH, but their activities are very low and the micro-organisms involved are largely unknown. Methane emissions by cultivated or natural wetlands are expressed in mg CH4.mbz.h-I with a median lower than 10 mg CH,.m-.h-'. Methanotrophy in wetlands is most often expressed with the same unit. Methane oxidation by aerobic upland soils is rarely higher than 0. 1 mg CH,.m-'.h-'. Forest soils are the most active, followed by grasslands and cultivated soils. Factors that favour CH, emission from cultivated wetlands are mostly submersion and organic matter addition. Intermittent drainage and utilisation of the sulphate forms of N-fertilisers reduce CH, emission. Methane oxidation potential of upland soils is reduced by cultivation, especially by ammonium N-fertiliser application.},

Most modern mass spectrometers use electron impact sources and magnetic sector mass filters with detection by faraday cups and electron multipliers. Some of the performance characteristics typical of these instruments are described (sensitivity, mass discrimination). Extraction of noble gases from geological samples is for the most part achieved by phase separation, by thermal extraction (furnace) or by crushing in vacuo. The extracted gases need to be purified and separated by a combination of chemical and physical methods.

{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Giggenbach: 300 mL round bottom flask filled with 50 ml of 4-6 n NaOH
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} He can permeate Pyrex glass making this method difficult for measuring heavier noble gases
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Samples should be measured soon due to these high permeable rates (4{\%} of isotopic ratio within 8 weeks)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Analysis process is more complex than lead glass
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Lead-glass: inner surface area of container (74cm2)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} With a container of that size it will take 1000 years for the helium isotopic ratio to decrease 4{\%} so one can allow a sample sit for multiple years before analysis
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Lead glass containers also allow one to directly measure major and trace compositions via GC and/or quadrupole mass spectrometer, which allows you to measure noble gases as well
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Isotopic composistions such as 13C/12C, 15N/14N, 34S/32S can be measured when samples are collected in lead containers connected to cold traps to allow the water to condese out and leave the gas mixture as dry as possible
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Analysis of CO2 requires an extra cold trap that includes a solution of 1 M CuCl2 which will react with H2S (that generally intrerferes with the wavelengths at which CO2 is measured) and produce the precipitate CuS

abstract = {The 3-D P-wave velocity and P- to S-wave velocity ratio structure of the Yellowstone volcanic field, Wyoming, has been determined from local earthquake tomography using new data from the permanent Yellowstone seismic network. We selected 3374 local earthquakes between 1995 and 2001 to invert for the 3-D P-wave velocity (Vp) and P-wave to S-wave velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) structure. Vpanomalies of small size (15×15 km) are reliably imaged in the northwestern part of the model outside the Yellowstone caldera; inside the caldera only Vpanomalies of large size extending over several grid nodes are reliably imaged. The Vp/Vssolution is generally poorer due to the low number of S-P arrival times. Only the northwestern part of the model is resolved with confidence; the Vp/Vssolution also suffers from strong vertical and horizontal velocity smearing. The tomographic images confirm the existence of a low Vp-body beneath the Yellowstone caldera at depths greater than 8 km, possibly representing hot, crystallizing magma. The most striking result of our study is a volume of anomalously low Vpand Vp/Vsin the northwestern part of the Yellowstone volcanic field at shallow depths of {\textless}2.0 km. Theoretical calculations of changes in P- to S-wave velocity ratios indicate that these anomalies can be interpreted as porous, gas-filled rock. The close spatial correlation of the observed anomalies and the occurrence of the largest earthquake swarm in historic time in Yellowstone, 1985, suggest that the gas may have originated as part of magmatic fluids released by crystallization of magma beneath the Yellowstone caldera. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Field observations of these basins provided the critical ground-truth for comparison with the remote sensing results. Fourteen study sites were selected based on diversity in size, deposit type, and thermal activity. Field work included detailed site surveys such as land cover analysis, photography, Global Positioning System (GPS) data collection, radiometric analysis, and VNIR spectroscopy. Samples of hot spring deposits, geyser deposits, and soil were also collected. Analysis of ASTER data provided broad scale characteristics of the hot springs and their deposits, including the identification of thermal anomalies. AVIRIS high spectral resolution short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy provided the ability to detect hydrothermally altered minerals as well as a calibration for the multispectral SWIR ASTER data. From the image analysis, differences in these basins were identified including the extent of thermal alteration, the location and abundance of alteration minerals, and a comparison of active, near-extinct, and extinct geysers. We determined the activity level of each region using a combination of the VNIR-SWIR-TIR spectral differences as well as the presence of elevated temperatures, detected by the TIR subsystem of ASTER. The results of this study are applicable to the exploration of extinct mineralized hydrothermal deposits on both Earth and Mars. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We report new helium isotope analyses of olivine and clinopyroxene separates from recent lavas for eleven volcanoes from Flores in the east Sunda arc through the inactive segment between the arcs to Banda Island at the extreme of the contiguous Banda arc. In the east Sunda arc, 3He4He ratios (R) vary between 4.5 RA (RA = air 3He4He) for the leucitic Batu Tara volcano to a remarkable low of pure radiogenic helium (0.0075 RA) for Werung at the southern tip of Lomblen Island. Lavas from the inactive zone, which represents the locus of collision of the Australian continent with the arc, have a narrower range in R RA-from 3.9 for Kisu in the straits of Pantar to 1.0 for Romang Island. Our one locality (Banda Island) in the Banda arc gives the highest R RA ratio (3.1) observed along this arc to date. The results are consistent with the involvement of crustal material in magma genesis throughout the east Sunda/Banda arcs, as far west as Iya in central Flores. We combine these helium isotope results with published and on-going strontium isotope studies, and show that the source of the helium in the crustal component is unlikely to be terrigenous sediments derived from the Australian continent; rather, degassing of Australian continental crust appears to be the dominant process controlling the helium budget. The He-Sr isotope systematics also provide a framework to account for the areal pattern of 3He4He in this part of the arcs: the radiogenic crustal component is diluted with mantle helium both in a down-dip direction and with increasing lateral distance from the collision zone. These factors result in an excellent first-order relationship between the 3He4He ratio, degree of He Sr enrichment (relative to the postulated mantle endmember), and alkalinity of the erupted lavas. Such a relationship has a direct bearing on models of the tectonic evolution of the collision zone, and on the observation that helium isotopes are decoupled from strontium and other geochemical signatures along the Banda arc. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Methane is not related to mantle or magma degassing. The abiogenic fraction accounts for about half of the total gas released, which is estimated to be well beyond 50 ton year22121. Ophiolites and limestones are in contact along a tectonic dislocation leading to gas mixing and migration to the Earth's surface. Chimaera represents the biggest emission of abiogenic methane on land discovered so far. Deep and pressurized gas accumulations are necessary to sustain the Chimaera gas flow for thousands of years and are likely to have been charged by an active inorganic source.},

abstract = {Ultra-basic (pH 11-12) reducing (-656 to -585mV) groundwater springs discharging from serpentinized peridotite of The Cedars, CA, were investigated for their geochemistry and geobiology. The spring waters investigated were of meteoric origin; however, geochemical modeling suggests that there were two sources of groundwater, a shallow source with sufficient contact with The Cedars' peridotite body to be altered geochemically by serpentinization, and a deeper groundwater source that not only flows through the peridotite body but was also in contact with the marine sediments of the Franciscan Subduction Complex (FSC) below the peridotite body. We propose that the groundwater discharging from lower elevations (GPS1 and CS1) reflect the geochemistry of the deeper groundwater in contact with FSC, while groundwaters discharging from springs at higher elevations (NS1 and BSC) were a mixture of the shallow peridotite-only groundwater and the deeper groundwater that has been in contact with the FSC. Cell densities of suspended microbes within these waters were extremely low. In the NS1 and BSC spring fluids, cell densities ranged from 102 to 103 cells/ml, while suspended cells at GPS were lower than 10cells/mL. However, glass slides incubated in the BSC and GPS1 springs for 2-3weeks were colonized by cells with densities ranging from 106 to 107 cells/cm2 attached to their surfaces. All of the springs were very low (≤1$\mu$M) in several essential elements and electron acceptors (e.g. nitrate/ammonium, sulfate, and phosphate) required for (microbial) growth, which is not uncommon at sites of continental serpentinization. Gases rich in N2, H2, and CH4 were exsolving from the springs. The stable carbon isotope value ($\delta$13CCH4=-68±0.6‰) and the CH4/C2+ ({\textgreater}103) of methane and other gaseous hydrocarbons exsolving from NS1 were typical of microbially sourced methane, whereas the isotope values and the CH4/C2+ of BSC and CS1 springs were more enriched in 13C and had CH4/C2+{\textless}103, suggesting a mixture of microbial and non-microbial methane. The concentrations of aromatic compounds, and ethane, propane, iso- and n-butane were well described by simple physical mixing between the aromatic- and alkane-poor, shallow groundwater and the relatively aromatic, and alkane-rich groundwater that flows through both the peridotite and the FSC suggesting that these aromatic and alkane compounds originated in the deeper FSC groundwater and are not produced in the shallow peridotite-only groundwater. The aromatic compounds most probably originated from the diagenesis/degradation of organic matter in the marine sediments below the peridotite body, while the gaseous alkanes may have multiple sources including thermal degradation of the organic matter in the marine sediments below the peridotite body and possibly by abiogenic reactions occurring within the peridotite body. This geochemical study demonstrates the complexity of The Cedars, and the possible sources of hydrocarbons at continental sites of serpentinization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The presence of aqueously altered, olivine-rich rocks along with carbonate on Mars suggest that serpentinization may have occurred in the past and may be occurring presently in the subsurface, and possibly contributing methane (CH4) to the martian atmosphere. Serpentinization, the hydration of olivine in ultramafic rocks, yields ultra-basic fluids (pH≥10) with unique chemistry (i.e. Ca2+-OH- waters) and hydrogen gas, which can support abiogenic production of hydrocarbons (i.e. Fischer-Tropsch Type synthesis) and subsurface chemosynthetic metabolisms. Mars analogue sites of present-day serpentinization can be used to determine what geochemical measurements are required for determining the source methane at sites of serpentinization on Earth and possibly on Mars. The Tablelands Ophiolite is a continental site of present-day serpentinization and a Mars analogue due to the presence of altered olivine-rich ultramafic rocks with both carbonate and serpentine signatures. This study describes the geochemical indicators of present-day serpentinization as evidenced by meteoric ultra-basic reducing groundwater discharging from ultramafic rocks, and travertine and calcium carbonate sediment, which form at the discharge points of the springs. Dissolved hydrogen concentrations (0.06-1.20mg/L) and methane (0.04-0.30mg/L) with $\delta$13CCH4 values (-28.5‰ to -15.6‰) were measured in the spring fluids. Molecular and isotopic analyses of CH4, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and hexane suggest a non-microbial source of methane, and attribute the origin of methane and higher hydrocarbon gases to either thermogenic or abiogenic pathways. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The occurrence and origin of methane (CH4) generated by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks is of current timely interest in planetary geology, astrobiology and energy resource exploration, as it may contribute, in particular, to decipher the source of methane on Mars, the origin of life and the potential of abiotic hydrocarbon synthesis. Methane of dominant abiotic origin in serpentinized peridotites on continents (ophiolites or igneous intrusions) has been documented so far, with complete carbon and hydrogen isotope composition, in six countries, in the Philippines, Turkey, Oman, New Zealand, Japan and Italy. We report the discovery of two new sites in Greece, at Archani and Ekkara, located in the Othrys ophiolite massif. Portable sensors based on Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometry (FTIR) and Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) allowed to realize that out of 21 ophiolitic springs, methane is released only by four hyperalkaline (pH from 10.7 to 11.3) and calcium hydroxide (Ca-OH) type waters; all other 17 springs with pH{\textless}8.7 and magnesium-rich waters in the Pindos, Vourinos and Veria ophiolites, do not show methane. This correlation between gas occurrence and water type seems to occur worldwide; accordingly, CH4 production appears to be intimately related to the depth and residence time of the circulating meteoric waters. Methane is emitted into the atmosphere also from the soil surrounding the hyperalkaline springs, with fluxes of the same order of magnitude ({\~{}}102-103mgm-2day-1) of seepage typically observed over conventional petroleum systems. Othrys CH4 has an isotopic composition (??13C from -27??? to -37.3??? VPDB, ??2H from -250??? to -311??? VSMOW) similar to that reported in ultramafic rocks in New Zealand and Japan, and in Precambrian crystalline shields, which were considered dominantly abiotic and probably derived from Fischer-Tropsch Type reactions. The paucity of CO2, which is the norm in hyperalkaline waters, and of other hydrocarbons prevents from evaluating possible mixing of gas of different sources, including microbial methanogenesis. Also the H2 content is trivial, notwithstanding it being a typical product of serpentinization; this could be due to complete H2 consumption by CO2 reduction in a limited or decreased H2 production system due, for example, to a late stage of increased silica activity, as suggested by preliminary petrographic observations. The low geothermal gradient of the area and the present-day serpentinization imply that, whatever the CH4 production mechanism, it took place at temperatures below those traditionally considered for the origin of abiotic methane in hydrothermal systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During 2002 and 2003, carbon dioxide fluxes were measured across the Rotorua geothermal system in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand. The results of a 956-measurement survey and of modeling studies show that CO2fluxes could be used to determine the main hot fluid upflow areas in Rotorua, and perhaps in undeveloped geothermal regions. Elevated degassing was observed along inferred fault traces and structures, lending confidence to their existence at depth. Degassing was also observed along lineaments that were consistent with the alignment of basement faulting in the TVZ. Areas where elevated degassing was spatially extensive typically overlapped with known regions of hot ground; however, elevated CO2fluxes were also observed in isolated patches of non-thermal ground. The total emission rate calculated from sequential Gaussian simulation modeling of CO2fluxes across the geothermal system was 620 t d-1from an 8.9-km2area. However, because approximately one-third of the geothermal system is known to extend beneath Lake Rotorua, we expect the emissions could be minimally on the order of 1000 t d-1. Comparing the emission rate with geochemical analyses of geothermal fluids and estimated upflows suggests that the majority of deep carbon reaches the surface in the form of carbon dioxide gas, and that less than one tenth of the CO2emissions is dissolved in, or released from, the fluids at depth. Thus, the geothermal reservoir exerts very little control on deep degassing of CO2. Carbon isotopic analyses of soil gases suggest a primarily magmatic source for the origin of the CO2. The total Rotorua emission rate is comparable to those from active volcanoes such as at White Island, New Zealand, and, when normalized by geothermal area, is comparable to other volcanic and hydrothermal regions worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Degassing of the Earth's mantle through magmatism results in the irreversible loss of helium to space, and high (3)He/(4)He ratios observed in oceanic basalts have been considered the main evidence for a 'primordial' undegassed deep mantle reservoir. Here we present a new global data compilation of ocean island basalts, representing upwelling 'plumes' from the deep mantle, and show that island groups with the highest primordial signal (high (3)He/(4)He ratios) have striking chemical and isotopic similarities to mid-ocean-ridge basalts. We interpret this as indicating a common history of mantle trace element depletion through magmatism. The high (3)He/(4)He in plumes may thus reflect incomplete degassing of the deep Earth during continent and ocean crust formation. We infer that differences between plumes and the upper-mantle source of ocean-ridge basalts reflect isolation of plume sources from the convecting mantle for approximately 1-2 Gyr. An undegassed, primordial reservoir in the mantle would therefore not be required, thus reconciling a long-standing contradiction in mantle dynamics.},

abstract = {We sampled fumaroles and hot springs from the Heart Lake Geyser Basin (HLGB), measured water and gas discharge, and estimated heat and mass flux from this geothermal area in 2009. The combined data set reveals that diverse fluids share an origin by mixing of deep solute-rich parent water with dilute heated meteoric water, accompanied by subsequent boiling. A variety of chemical and isotopic geothermometers are consistent with a parent water that equilibrates with rocks at 205 degrees C +/- 10 degrees C and then undergoes 21{\%} +/- 2{\%} adiabatic boiling. Measured diffuse CO2 flux and fumarole compositions are consistent with an initial dissolved CO2 concentration of 21 +/- 7 mmol upon arrival at the caldera boundary and prior to southeast flow, boiling, and discharge along the Witch Creek drainage. The calculated advective flow from the basin is 78 +/- 16 L s(-1) of parent thermal water, corresponding to 68 +/- 14 MW, or similar to 1{\%} of the estimated thermal flux from Yellowstone. Helium and carbon isotopes reveal minor addition of locally derived crustal, biogenic, and meteoric gases as this fluid boils and degasses, reducing the He isotope ratio (Rc/Ra) from 2.91 to 1.09. The HLGB is one of the few thermal areas at Yellowstone that approaches a closed system, where a series of progressively boiled waters can be sampled along with related steam and noncondensable gas. At other Yellowstone locations, steam and gas are found without associated neutral Cl waters (e. g., Hot Spring Basin) or Cl-rich waters emerge without significant associated steam and gas (Upper Geyser Basin).},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and its 13C/12C ratio have been simulated with a three-dimensional transport model which predicts variations on time scales from synoptic to annual. This paper describes the results of model simulations of the mean annual fields of CO2, on the assumption that the carbon cycle has no time variations longer than 1 year. Interannual variations are addressed, however, by defining a series of four quasi-stationary states which characterize the average nonseasonal cycle for four historical periods: 1962, 1968, 1980, and 1984. Meridional variations predicted by the model for these periods are compared with observational data obtained from an array of stations extending from the Arctic to the South Pole. An adjustable parameter in the model controls the predicted average release of CO2 by the tropical oceans, and another the uptake of CO2 by the north Atlantic Ocean. These two parameters are globally adjusted to achieve an optimal fit of the model predictions to the observations of CO2 concentration. Good fits are realized under a variety of assumptions about the strengths and locations of sources and sinks of the terrestrial biosphere, indicating that the model is not closely constrained on the basis of CO2 concentration data alone. The model's prediction of the 13C/12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 is acceptable, however, only if the prescribed net terrestrial biospheric exchange at high northern latitudes is overshadowed by the postulated oceanic sink in the North Atlantic. By far the largest contributor to meridional variations in both concentration and 13C/12C ratio is the combustion of fossil fuels, 95 percent of which are injected into the northern hemisphere. The build-up of CO2 in the northern hemisphere in response to this injection is clearly seen in the comparison of the historical profiles which cover a period in which the injection doubled from 2.6 to 5.3 × 1012 kgC yr−1. In contrast, the model predictions of the adjustable oceanic sources and sinks vary by less than 0.4×1012 kgC yr−1 from their mean value from one historical period to another, suggesting only relatively minor changes in these natural exchanges of CO2 from 1962 to 1984.},

abstract = {Active volcanoes exhibit diffuse gas emanations through the ground, the most abundant species of which is CO2. However, the relationship between diffuse degassing and volcanic activity is not often clear and some volcanoes may have low diffuse degassing levels despite having strong volcanic activity. The main goals of this study are to quantify diffuse CO2 degassing and determine whether patterns exist in relation to volcanic activity through the study of Turrialba, Po{\'{a}}s and Iraz{\'{u}}, three active volcanoes in Costa Rica which are at different stages of activity. Structural controls of spatial distribution of diffuse degassing were also investigated. Measurement campaigns were conducted using the accumulation chamber method coupled with 10 cm depth ground temperature sampling with the aim of estimating the total diffuse CO2 degassing budget. The total amount of CO2 emitted diffusely by each volcano is approximately 113 ± 46 t/d over {\~{}} 0.705 km2 for Turrialba, 0.9 ± 0.5 t/d for Po{\'{a}}s over {\~{}} 0.734 km2, 3.8 ± 0.9 t/d over {\~{}} 0.049 km2 for Iraz{\'{u}}'s main crater, and 15 ± 12 t/d over 0.0059 km2 for Iraz{\'{u}}'s north flank. Turrialba and Po{\'{a}}s volcano diffuse degassing budget represent about 10$\backslash${\%} of the whole gas output. Both volcanoes were in a transitional stage and the opening of new conduits may cause a loss in diffuse degassing and an increase of active degassing. Numerous diffuse degassing structures were also identified. One of which at Turrialba was closely associated with the collapse of a crater wall in 2014 during the initiation of a new period of heightened eruptive activity. Similar structures were also observed on the outer slopes of the west crater, suggesting strong alteration and perhaps destabilization of the upper outer cone. Iraz{\'{u}}'s north flank is highly permeable and has experienced intense hydrothermal alteration.},

abstract = {The Valles caldera formed during two major rhyolitic ignimbrite eruptive episodes (the Bandelier Tuff) at 1.61 and 1.22 Ma, after some 12 m.y. of activity in the Jemez Mountains volcanic field, New Mexico. Several subsequent eruptions between 1.22 and 0.52 Ma produced dominantly high-silica rhyolite lava domes and tephras within the caldera. These were followed by a dormancy of 0.46 m.y. prior to the most recent intracaldera activity, the longest hiatus since the inception of the Bandelier magma system at similar to 1.8 Ma. The youngest volcanic activity at similar to 60 ka produced the SW moat rhyolites, a series of lavas and tuffs that display abundant petrologic evidence of being newly generated melts. Petrographic textures conform closely to published predictions for silicic magmas generated by intrusion of basaltic magma into continental crust. The Valles caldera may currently be the site of renewed silicic magma generation, induced by intrusion of mafic magma at depth, Recent seismic investigations revealed the presence of a large low-velocity anomaly in the lower crust beneath the caldera, The generally aseismic character of the caldera, despite abundant regional seismicity, may be attributed to a heated crustal column, the local effect of 13 m.y. of magmatism and emplacement of mid-crustal plutons. Seismic signals of magma movement in the deep to mid-crust may therefore be masked, and clear seismic indications of intrusion may only be generated within a few kilometres of the surface. We therefore encourage the establishment of a local dedicated volcanic monitoring system.},

abstract = {We characterize and quantify volatile emissions at Hot Spring Basin (HSB), a large acid-sulfate region that lies just outside the northeastern edge of the 640 ka Yellowstone Caldera. Relative to other thermal areas in Yellowstone, HSB gases are rich in He and H2, and mildly enriched in CH4 and H2S. Gas compositions are consistent with boiling directly off a deep geothermal liquid at depth as it migrates toward the surface. This fluid, and the gases evolved from it, carries geochemical signatures of magmatic volatiles and water–rock reactions with multiple crustal sources, including limestones or quartz-rich sediments with low K/U (or 40⁎Ar/4⁎He). Variations in gas chemistry across the region reflect reservoir heterogeneity and variable degrees of boiling. Gas-geothermometer temperatures approach 300 °C and suggest that the reservoir feeding HSB is one of the hottest at Yellowstone. Diffuse CO2 flux in the western basin of HSB, as measured by accumulation-chamber methods, is similar in magnitude to other acid-sulfate areas of Yellowstone and is well correlated to shallow soil temperatures. The extrapolation of diffuse CO2 fluxes across all the thermal/altered area suggests that 410±140 t d−1 CO2 are emitted at HSB (vent emissions not included). Diffuse fluxes of H2S were measured in Yellowstone for the first time and likely exceed 2.4 t d−1 at HSB. Comparing estimates of the total estimated diffuse H2S emission to the amount of sulfur as SO42− in streams indicates {\~{}}50{\%} of the original H2S in the gas emission is lost into shallow groundwater, precipitated as native sulfur, or vented through fumaroles. We estimate the heat output of HSB as {\~{}}140–370 MW using CO2 as a tracer for steam condensate, but not including the contribution from fumaroles and hydrothermal vents. Overall, the diffuse heat and volatile fluxes of HSB are as great as some active volcanoes, but they are a small fraction (1–3{\%} for CO2, 2–8{\%} for heat) of that estimated for the entire Yellowstone system.},

abstract = {Earth{\&}{\#}039;s largest calderas form as the ground collapses during immense volcanic eruptions, when hundreds to thousands of cubic kilometres of magma are explosively withdrawn from the Earth{\&}{\#}039;s crust over a period of days to weeks. Continuing long after such great eruptions, the resulting calderas often exhibit pronounced unrest, with frequent earthquakes, alternating uplift and subsidence of the ground, and considerable heat and mass flux. Because many active and extinct calderas show evidence for repetition of large eruptions, such systems demand detailed scientific study and monitoring. Two calderas in North America, Yellowstone (Wyoming) and Long Valley (California), are in areas of youthful tectonic complexity. Scientists strive to understand the signals generated when tectonic, volcanic and hydrothermal (hot ground water) processes intersect. One obstacle to accurate forecasting of large volcanic events is humanity{\&}{\#}039;s lack of familiarity with the signals leading up to the largest class of volcanic eruptions. Accordingly, it may be difficult to recognize the difference between smaller and larger eruptions. To prepare ourselves and society, scientists must scrutinize a spectrum of volcanic signals and assess the many factors contributing to unrest and toward diverse modes of eruption.},

Here, a hydrothermally formed nickel-iron alloy was shown to catalyze the otherwise prohibitively slow formation of abiogenic CH4 from dissolved bicarbonate (HCO3-) under hydrothermal conditions. Isotopic fractionation by the catalyst resulted in delta(13)C values of the CH4 formed that are as Low as those typically observed for microbial methane, with similarly high CH4/(C2H6 + C3H8) ratios. These results, combined with the increasing recognition of nickel-iron alloy occurrence in oceanic crusts, suggest that abiogenic methane may be more widespread than previously thought.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the carbon isotopic composition of CO2, methane, ethane, propane and n-butane, the hydrogen isotopic composition of methane as well as total concentrations of gas constituents contained in the Mediterranean volcanic-hydrothermal discharges of Nisyros (Greece), Vesuvio, La Solfatara, Ischia and Pantelleria (all Italy) to determine the origin of the hydrocarbons. Isotopic criteria conventionally used for hydrocarbon classification suggest thermogenic origins, except for Pantelleria, for which an abiogenic origin is indicated. These findings would imply that thermogenic sources can provide methane/(ethane+propane) concentration ratios as high as those usually observed for microbial hydrocarbons. However, additional consideration of gas concentration data challenges the suitability of conventional criteria for the classification of hydrocarbons emanating from hydrothermal environments. Methane seems to be in close equilibrium with co-occurring CO2, whereas its higher chain homologues are not. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that methane on the one hand and ethane, propane and n-butane on the other hand have distinct origins. The carbon isotopic composition of methane might be controlled by the carbon isotopic composition of co-occurring inorganic CO2 and by hydrothermal temperatures whereas the carbon isotopic composition of the higher n-alkanes could correspond to the maturity of organic matter and/or to the residence time of the gasses in the source system.},

abstract = {The Valles Caldera complex in north–central New Mexico, USA, represents the type example of a resurgent caldera system, characterized by eruption of two voluminous high-silica rhyolite ignimbrites, the Otowi and Tshirege Members of the Bandelier Tuff. Central resurgence of ∼1000 m occurred within 27 ± 27 kyr following eruption of the Tshirege, or Upper Bandelier Tuff (UBT). This process was accompanied by small-volume eruptions of the Deer Canyon Rhyolite, followed closely by the Redondo Creek Rhyodacite. The Cerro del Medio Rhyolite lava dome complex is a product of ring fracture volcanism following resurgence. We have combined cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging and titanium-in-quartz geothermometry techniques for single quartz crystals from (1) different stratigraphic horizons of the UBT ignimbrite, (2) samples of the Deer Canyon Rhyolite and (3) the Cerro del Medio Rhyolite lavas to build an evolutionary model of the Valles Caldera lifecycle. CL imaging reveals that ∼70{\%} by volume of the UBT ignimbrite contains unzoned quartz crystals (average concentration 28 ± 2 ppm Ti), recording relatively stable conditions. The abrupt appearance of compositionally zoned quartz crystals within the mid-to-late erupted UBT ignimbrite units 3–5 reveals evidence for interaction with hotter magma. Corresponding titanium-in-quartz measurements of outer, high-intensity CL rims (average of 71 ± 9 ppm Ti) reveal temperature increases of between ∼35 and 140°C relative to the initial, volumetrically large Upper Member eruptions (flow units 1 and 2). These temperature increases mimic those originally reported in the literature. Compared with the temperature increases, changes in pressure appear to play a secondary role. We have also discovered an interesting heterogeneity within the Deer Canyon Rhyolite lavas, with strong spatial control on the eruption of porphyritic lavas containing complexly zoned quartz crystals on the western parts of the resurgent dome. Conversely, crystal-poor to aphyric lavas containing small, unzoned quartz crystals are confined to eastern parts of the resurgent dome. The Cerro del Medio Rhyolite lavas are sparsely porphyritic to aphyric, and contain unzoned quartz with titanium concentrations more than 40 ppm higher than the cores of UBT quartz. The quartz-free Redondo Creek Rhyodacite is the most primitive silicic material erupted during the Valles Caldera cycle. Intrusion of this hotter magma into a residual UBT crystal mush zone may have facilitated eruption and geochemical–thermal heterogeneity within the Deer Canyon Rhyolite, resurgence of the caldera, and expulsion of hot, crystal-poor rhyolite batches from the mush zone, which were subsequently erupted as the Cerro del Medio complex.},

The structural resurgent dome of the Valles caldera was uplifted approximately 1000 m above the surrounding caldera floor during resurgence. The upper Bandelier Tuff, which yields an age of 1.256 ± 0.010 Ma (2$\sigma$; ages relative to Fish Canyon tuff sanidine at 28.02 Ma), is the lower constraint on the timing of resurgence. The oldest postcollapse ring fracture dome, Cerro del Medio, is the upper time constraint and yields an age of 1.229 ± 0.017 Ma for one of its oldest flow lobes. Therefore resurgent uplift probably occurred within 54 ka, at a minimum rate of 1.9 cm/yr. Sanidine phenocrysts from rhyolites of the postcollapse intracaldera Deer Canyon and Redondo Creek members yield 40Ar/39Ar single-crystal laser fusion ages ranging from 1.229 ± 0.013 Ma to 1.283 ± 0.017 Ma (Deer Canyon Member; n = 8) and 1.208 ± 0.017 Ma to 1.239 ± 0.017 Ma (Redondo Creek Member; n = 4). With one exception from each unit, these ages are statistically indistinguishable from the upper Bandelier Tuff, indicating that eruption of these postcollapse rhyolites probably commenced shortly after caldera formation.

abstract = {The Guanacaste Geothermal Province encompasses three major geothermal systems, each centered on its respective volcanic structure: Rincon de la Vieja to the NW, Miravalles in the center and Tenorio to the SE. Each shows corresponding sets of surface manifestations: vapor discharges from fumaroles and steam-heated pools at altitudes {\textgreater}500 m; lower temperature SO4- Cl springs on the lower slopes of the respective volcano; and cooler neutral Cl springs to the S of the volcanic chain, at altitudes {\textless}500 m. The production of HCO3-rich waters is limited to a narrow belt stretching to the S of Miravalles volcano. Chemical and isotopic evidence suggests that the neutral Cl waters, also discharged from deep wells, are derived from a more primitive Cl-SO4 water formed by transfer of readily mobilised, originally magmatic constituents to deeply circulating groundwater. Isotopic evidence suggests that this groundwater is derived largely from areas to the north of the volcanic chain. The presence of immature waters within drillable depth is indicated by the incursion of an acid SO4 water into a well at Miravalles after deepening to 2000 m. As the Cl waters rise, they start to boil. The separated vapors feed the fumaroles and steam-heated features at thc surface, the residual water travels underground to be discharged some 5- 25 km to the S. The uniformity in chemical and isotopic compositions of the neutral Cl waters is compatible with the assumption that the individual thermal systems are linked at depth to form large, contiguous geothermal reservoirs beneath the Guanacaste Geothermal Province.},

abstract = {Conditional sequential Gaussian simulations (sGs) have been applied for the first time to the study of soil diffuse degassing from different volcanic and nonvolcanic systems. The application regards five data sets of soil CO2 fluxes measured with the accumulation chamber methodology at the volcanic areas of Solfatara of Pozzuoli (Italy), Vesuvio cone (Italy), Nisyros (Greece), and Horseshoe Lake (California) and at the nonvolcanic degassing area of Poggio dell'Olivo (Italy). The sGs algorithm was used to generate 100 realizations of CO2 flux for each area. Probabilistic summaries of these simulations, together with the information given by probability plots, were used (1) to draw maps of the probability that CO2 fluxes exceed thresholds specific for a background flux, i.e., to define the probable extension of the degassing structures, (2) to calculate the total CO2 output, and (3) to quantify the uncertainty of the estimation. The results show that the sGs is a suitable tool to model soil diffuse degassing, producing realistic images of the distribution of the CO2 fluxes that honor the histogram and variogram of the original data. Moreover, the relation between the sample design and the uncertainty of estimation was investigated leading to an empirical relation between uncertainty and the sampling density that can be useful for the planning of future CO2 flux surveys.},

abstract = {Expansion of shale gas extraction has fuelled global concern about the potential impact of fugitive methane on groundwater and climate. Although methane leakage from wells is well documented, the consequences on groundwater remain sparsely studied and are thought by some to be minor. Here we present the results of a 72-day methane gas injection experiment into a shallow, flat-lying sand aquifer. In our experiment, although a significant fraction of methane vented to the atmosphere, an equal portion remained in the groundwater. We find that methane migration in the aquifer was governed by subtle grain-scale bedding that impeded buoyant free-phase gas flow and led to episodic releases of free-phase gas. The result was lateral migration of gas beyond that expected by groundwater advection alone. Methane persisted in the groundwater zone despite active growth of methanotrophic bacteria, although much of the methane that vented into the vadose zone was oxidized. Our findings demonstrate that even small-volume releases of methane gas can cause extensive and persistent free phase and solute plumes emanating from leaks that are detectable only by contaminant hydrogeology monitoring at high resolution.},

abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, and its atmospheric concentration has nearly tripled since pre-industrial times. The growth rate of atmospheric methane is determined by the balance between surface emissions and photochemical destruction by the hydroxyl radical, the major atmospheric oxidant. Remarkably, this growth rate has decreased markedly since the early 1990s, and the level of methane has remained relatively constant since 1999, leading to a downward revision of its projected influence on global temperatures. Large fluctuations in the growth rate of atmospheric methane are also observed from one year to the next, but their causes remain uncertain. Here we quantify the processes that controlled variations in methane emissions between 1984 and 2003 using an inversion model of atmospheric transport and chemistry. Our results indicate that wetland emissions dominated the inter-annual variability of methane sources, whereas fire emissions played a smaller role, except during the 1997-1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o event. These top-down estimates of changes in wetland and fire emissions are in good agreement with independent estimates based on remote sensing information and biogeochemical models. On longer timescales, our results show that the decrease in atmospheric methane growth during the 1990s was caused by a decline in anthropogenic emissions. Since 1999, however, they indicate that anthropogenic emissions of methane have risen again. The effect of this increase on the growth rate of atmospheric methane has been masked by a coincident decrease in wetland emissions, but atmospheric methane levels may increase in the near future if wetland emissions return to their mean 1990s levels.},

These easily detected anomalies originate with the arrival of CH4-poor magmatic fluids in the shallower levels of the volcanoes. The data suggest that volcanoes are characterized by magmatic activity at depth also in periods of apparent quiescence. The activity is constituted by the pulsing release of large amount of fluids which either cause unrest periods (seismicity and ground deformation) or possibly could precede volcanic eruption. This type of volcanic activity can be monitored trough the classical geophysical techniques together with the systematic sampling and analysis of fumaroles. },

We include appendixes containing photos of sample sites, geographic information system (GIS) files including shape and kml formats, and analytical results in spreadsheets. In addition, we provide a lengthy discussion of previous work on gas chemistry at Yellowstone and a general discussion of the implications of our results. We demonstrate that gases collected from different thermal areas often have distinct chemical signatures, and that differences across the thermal areas are not a simple function of surface temperatures or the type of feature. Instead, gas chemistry and isotopic composition are linked to subsurface lithologies and varying contributions from magmatic, crustal, and meteoric sources.},

abstract = {Like their liquid counterparts, gas geothermometers are based upon either empirical or thermodynamic equations for chemical reactions thought to equilibrate in geothermal reservoirs. Presentations of geothermometer results take three different general forms: equations, y–T grids and gas ratio grids. Among the thermodynamics-based geothermometers, the H2, CO, HSH, H2S, CO2 and CO2–H2 geothermometer reactions appear to equilibrate at usual reservoir conditions, but the Fischer-Tropsch and NAH geothermometer reactions are likely too slow. Empirical geothermometers have been proposed for a number of gas combinations, but they either do not provide an advantage over their thermodynamic counterparts or, in the case of the DAP geothermometer, do not perform as expected. The y–T gas grid geothermometers employ a combination of two geothermometer reactions to allow the simultaneous determination of y (the fraction of a hypothetical equilibrated reservoir steam) and temperature. Processes that modify fumarole gas concentrations, such as reservoir boiling and near surface condensation adversely affect y–T grid results, limiting their application. They also suffer from uncertainty as to the appropriateness of the y model to a particular steam source. Gas ratio grids overcome some of these difficulties by fixing hydrogen fugacities through the assumption of a single redox state for the system, and by using argon concentration as a proxy for PH2O. They suffer from ambiguities with respect to the source of argon, but most of these can be adequately accounted for. Argon is sensitive to air contamination and volcanic input, and there are indications that its concentration in hydrothermal water of meteoric origin may deviate from that of air saturated ground water. While there usually are ambiguities with respect to the application any gas geothermometer, they can often be addressed satisfactorily by an interpretative approach which looks for consistency among a variety of y–T and gas ratio grids, and integrates information from other sources, such as stable isotope and noble gas chemistry. },

abstract = {Over the last 30 years, geochemical research has demonstrated that abiotic methane (CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), formed by chemical reactions which do not directly involve organic matter, occurs on Earth in several specific geologic environments. It can be produced by either high-temperature magmatic processes in volcanic and geothermal areas, or via low-temperature ({\textless}100°C) gas-water-rock reactions in continental settings, even at shallow depths. The isotopic composition of C and H is a first step in distinguishing abiotic from biotic (including either microbial or thermogenic) CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. Herein we demonstrate that integrated geochemical diagnostic techniques, based on molecular composition of associated gases, noble gas isotopes, mixing models, and a detailed knowledge of the geologic and hydrogeologic context are necessary to confirm the occurrence of abiotic CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in natural gases, which are frequently mixtures of multiple sources. Although it has been traditionally assumed that abiotic CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is mainly related to mantle-derived or magmatic processes, a new generation of data is showing that low-temperature synthesis related to gas-water-rock reactions is more common than previously thought. This paper reviews the major sources of abiotic CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the primary approaches for differentiating abiotic from biotic CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4,{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} including novel potential tools such as clumped isotope geochemistry. A diagnostic approach for differentiation is proposed.

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Also from bulk hydrocarbon analysis concentrations of light hydrocarbons are distributed using a Schulz-Flory distribution

2.5 | Metamorphism of Carbonate-Graphite Rocks

3.1 | Occurene and Abundance of Abiotic CH4

- Abiotic synthesis of gas-water-rock reactions provide greater amounts of hydrocarbons at the {\%} level as ooposed to magam degassing which is at the ppm or ppb level
- Low temperature ({\textless}150°C) serpentenization of ultramafic rocks are capable of producing CH4 
- Terresterial serpentenization that occurs in hyperalkaline (pH {\textgreater} 10)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This occurs at temperatures below 100°C

abstract = {Gas emissions at the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field (YPVF) reflect open-system mixing of gas species originating from diverse rock types, magmas, and crustal fluids, all combined in varying proportions at different thermal areas. Gases are not necessarily in chemical equilibrium with the waters through which they vent, especially in acid sulfate terrain where bubbles stream through stagnant acid water. Gases in adjacent thermal areas often can be differentiated by isotopic and gas ratios, and cannot be tied to one another solely by shallow processes such as boiling-induced fractionation of a parent liquid. Instead, they inherit unique gas ratios (e.g., CH4/He) from the dominant rock reservoirs where they originate, some of which underlie the Quaternary volcanic rocks. Steam/gas ratios (essentially H2O/CO2) of Yellowstone fumaroles correlate with Ar/He and N2/CO2, strongly suggesting that H2O/CO2 is controlled by addition of steam boiled from water rich in atmospheric gases. Moreover, H2O/CO2 varies systematically with geographic location, such that boiling is more enhanced in some areas than others. The $\delta$13C and 3He/CO2 of gases reflect a dominant mantle origin for CO2 in Yellowstone gas. The mantle signature is most evident at Mud Volcano, which hosts gases with the lowest H2O/CO2, lowest CH4 concentrations and highest He isotope ratios ({\~{}}16Ra), consistent with either a young subsurface intrusion or less input of crustal and meteoric gas than any other location at Yellowstone. Across the YPVF, He isotope ratios (3He/4He) inversely vary with He concentrations, and reflect varied amounts of long-stored, radiogenic He added to the magmatic endmember within the crust. Similarly, addition of CH4 from organic-rich sediments is common in the eastern thermal areas at Yellowstone. Overall, Yellowstone gases reflect addition of deep, high-temperature magmatic gas (CO2-rich), lower-temperatures crustal gases (4He- and CH4-bearing), and those gases (N2, Ne, Ar) added principally through boiling of the meteoric-water-derived geothermal liquid found in the upper few kilometers. We also briefly explore the pathways by which Cl, F, and S, move through the crust.},

2 | Why Study Aspirations: The Relation of Aspirations to Enrollment
- Cites Heller (2001): 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Students with BA/BS aspirations were 16{\%} less likely to enroll in grad school compared with students who aspired to enroll in a MS or MBA program
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Students with aspirations for a professional degree(?) are 30{\%} more likely to enroll in grad school than those with MA/MS aspirations 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Those with doctoral degree aspirations were 28{\%} more likely than MA/MS aspirers to enroll in grad school
***Students with inetentions to enroll in grad school showed as the strongest predictor for actual enrollment compared to other predictors (GPA, SATs, time spent studying, etc.) [cited Walpole (2007)]

3 | Status Attainment Theory and Precollege Characteristics
- Status Attainment Theory: educational aspirations are a function of individuals' background characteristics, sense of origin, prior academic achievement, and influence of significant others
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Background characteristcs: race, gender, parents' education/income
- From the literature, background characteristics show that women register for MA/MS programs in greater proportions than men but they register in smaller proportions in professional and doctoral degreess than men
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} For STEM, they cite Sax (2001) who states 25{\%} of women and 32{\%} of men who earned BA/BS degeres enrolled in graduate programs
- From Millett (2003) discovered that Black students were significantly less likely than White students to enroll in "first-choice" grad/prfoessional school; however, there was no significant difference between Asian-American and Latino in comparison to White students
- Testing ability did not have significant predictive power for Latino or Black students but did have a significant positive predictive power for White students (cited Pascarella et al (2004))},

abstract = {Many US biomedical PhD programs receive more applications for admissions than they can accept each year, necessitating a selective admissions process. Typical selection criteria include standardized test scores, undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, a resume and/or personal statement highlighting relevant research or professional experience, and feedback from interviews with training faculty. Admissions decisions are often founded on assumptions that these application components correlate with research success in graduate school, but these assumptions have not been rigorously tested. We sought to determine if any application components were predictive of student productivity measured by first-author student publications and time to degree completion. We collected productivity metrics for graduate students who entered the umbrella first-year biomedical PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 2008±2010 and analyzed components of their admissions applications. We found no correlations of test scores, grades, amount of previous research experience, or faculty interview ratings with high or low productivity among those applicants who were admitted and chose to matriculate at UNC. In contrast, ratings from recommendation letter writers were significantly stronger for students who published multiple first-author papers in graduate school than for those who published no first-author papers during the same timeframe. We conclude that the most commonly used standardized test (the general GRE) is a particularly ineffective predictive tool, but that qualitative assessments by previous mentors are more likely to identify students who will succeed in biomedical graduate research. Based on these results, we conclude that admissions committees should avoid over-reliance on any single component of the application and de-emphasize metrics that are minimally predictive of student productivity. We recommend continual tracking of desired training outcomes combined with retrospective analysis of admissions practices to guide both application requirements and holistic application review.},

0 | Abstract 
- Authors analyzed matriculated students in the UNC Biomedical PhD program between 2008-2010
- The authors found no correlation between metrics like undergrad GPA, GRE scores, or previous research experience to productivity at the grad school level
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} However, they found a consistency between strong letters of rec and grad school performance

1 | Introduction
- Previous studies (at UCSF) claim that GRE scores are not predictive of performance
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} However, critics disagree with the authors' definition of success
- The authors of this (UNC) study use quantifiable metrics such as publications and timeline to completion of degree

2 | Methods
- Sample Size: Cohort of 280 graduate students who entered the program of 2008-2010
- As of July 2016:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 195/280 (69.64{\%}) graduated with PhD
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 45/280 (16.07{\%}) were still enrolled
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 40/280 (14.28{\%}) graduated with a MS or withdrew
Metrics
- GRE/GPA
- Previous Research Experience
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Calculated in terms of months from Statement Letter, CV, and Letters of Rec
- Letters of Recommendation
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Only students with three complete recommendatinos were included in the "recommendation analysis" (n = 251, 251/280 [89.64{\%}])
- Interview Scores
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} A subset of students visited UNC, where one-on-one interviews were part of their itinerary
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Faculty noted their recommendations on a 1 to 5 scale
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Students who met with at least 4 faculty members were included in this part of the study (n = 142, 142/280 [50.71{\%}])
- Student publications
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Student publications were checked by using a seaching algorithm that queried the student's name and advisor's name for first author and co-authorships
- Student Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The students were divded into the following groups:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 3+: 3≥ first author pubs
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1-2: 1 or 2 first author pubs
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 0+: no first author pubs but at least one co-authorship
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 0: no pubs at all
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the different groups for significant differences

3 | Results
- Demographics: 61.4{\%} female, 22.9{\%} underrep racial/ethinic group
- 85-90 matriculate, from a pool 300 (200-250 are offered admission) that was selected from an application pool of ≈1300 students
- No significant difference between GRE and GPA scores with publicatin productivity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} With regard to GRE scores:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} males scroed higher than females
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Asian + White students scored higher than underrepresented minority groups
- Predictability of Letters of Rec
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Students with "enthusastic" and highly ranked recommender translated to grad stuidents with highly productive students - so much so that the stats show a significant difference between students who received less enthuisastic recommendations 

4 | Discussion
- Analysis in this study shows that the GRE fosters "unintended bias against certain groups that perform historically less well on the exam witout actually increasing excellence in the matriculating class"
- Authors were suprised that prior research experience was not predicitive of produtivity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Possible explanation, all students had lost of experience and thus there was no control group
- Authors suprised that the one-on-one interviews did not seperate the highly productive students from the less productive students ( I was not not surprised with this result)},

abstract = {Historically, admissions committees for biomedical Ph.D. programs have heavily weighed GRE scores when considering applications for admission. The predictive validity of GRE scores on graduate student success is unclear, and there have been no recent investigations specifically on the relationship between general GRE scores and graduate student success in biomedical research. Data from Vanderbilt University Medical School's biomedical umbrella program were used to test to what extent GRE scores can predict outcomes in graduate school training when controlling for other admissions information. Overall, the GRE did not prove useful in predicating who will graduate with a Ph.D., pass the qualifying exam, have a shorter time to defense, deliver more conference presentations, publish more first author papers, or obtain an individual grant or fellowship. GRE scores were found to be moderate predictors of first semester grades, and weak to moderate predictors of graduate GPA and some elements of a faculty evaluation. These findings suggest admissions committees of biomedical doctoral programs should consider minimizing their reliance on GRE scores to predict the important measures of progress in the program and student productivity.},

The models are based on (1) the concept of two-stage degassing of CO2 from magma supplied to the summit chamber, (2) C isotope data for CO2 in eruptive and noneruptive (quiescent) gases from Kilauea, and (3) data for the isotopic fractionation of C between CO2 and C dissolved in tholeiitic basalt melt. The results of our study indicate that (1) both eruptive and noneruptive degassing of CO2 most closely approach a batch equilibrium process, (2) the d13C of parental magma supplied to the summit chamber is in the range -4.1 to -3.4{\%}, and (3) the d13C of melt after summit chamber degassing is in the range -7 to -8{\%}, depending upon the depth of equilibration. We also present d13C data for CO2 in eruptive gases from the current East Rift Zone eruption. These are the first C isotope data for CO2 in high-temperature ({\textgreater}900°C) eruptive gases from Kilauea; they have a mean d13C value of -7.82 ± 0.24{\%} and are similar to those predicted for the melt after summit chamber degassing. The minor role played by fractional degassing of ascending magma at Kilauea means that exsolved CO2 tends to remain entrained in and coherent with its host melt during ascent from both mantle source regions and crustal magma reservoirs. This has important implications for magma dynamics at Kilauea.},

annote = {1 | Introduction

- Kinetics control this reaction at temperatures less than or equal to 200°C
- This geothermometer has been showed to be consistent with borehole measurements but overestimations from this thermometers have been shown to be as high as 300°C in some cases
- Three hypotheses that were proposed to explain these differences: 
1) bulk of CO2 and CH4 independent origins
2) isotopic equilibration between the carbon isotopes of the gases is disrupted because of the addition of CH4 and/or CO2 from different sources
3) Originally at isotopic equilibrium, the geothermometer records the temperature at formation at a greater depth than the borehole - in other words, the isotope ratio was "frozen in"
- CO2-CH4 exchange is the slowest rate among other potential thermometers (CO2-H2O [oxygen], H2O-H2 [hydrogen], CH4-H2 [hydrogen])

3 | Experimental Results

3.1 | | Non Equilibrium Results
- At 400° there was little change in the amount of CO2 and CH4
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} There was also a 4‰ increase for 13C-CO2, which was a "little" increase that only occurred at the beginning 
- The oxidation of CH4 to CO2 results in a negative fractionation (-26 to -32‰) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Studies by Kiyosu and Imaaizumi (1996) confirm similar fractionation for the oxidation of CH4 to CO2 (in the prescence of metalic oxides and calcium sulfate) at temps of 350-500°C
- Mechanistically, isotopic exchange between CH4 and CO2 are most likely facilitated by chemical reactions rather than molecular collisions
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These chemical reactions are facilitated by the surfaces of catalysts

3.2 || Equilibrium Results
- Ni was the catalyst that proved to be the most active
- Chemical equilibrium is necessary but not for sufficient for isotopic sufficient
- With decreasing temperature, more time is required for CO2 and CH4 to reach isotopic equilibrium
- When CO2 and CH4 are far from isotopic equilibrium, changes towards equilibrium may not be montonic
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This is because the elementary reactions fractionate carbon isotopes differently
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} CH4 to elemental carbon ={\textgreater} tens of ‰ at 800°C
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} CH4 to CO2 ={\textgreater} -12 to -25‰ at 300-530°C
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} CO to CO2 ={\textgreater} -10 to -20‰ at 50-180°C
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The amount of CO formed increased with temperature

{\textgreater}{\textgreater}**{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Only after chemical equilibrium is achieved will the isotopic compositions change smoothly until equilibrium is achieved

4 | Equilibrium Fractionation Factor
- Fractionation between CO2 and CH4 decreases with increasing temperature
- The authors added +0.89‰ to each of the the constants (Richet et al 1977, Eqn 5) in their final equation (Eqn7) because of the difference between the experiemental and theoretical values
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The reason for these differences include
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}a) the assumption of ideal gases even though the experimental conditions required the gases to be at pressures at least 10x higher than STP

abstract = {Direct measurement of present day CH4 diffuse degassing from the soil represents an effective tool to better estimate the degassing rate of individual sources and to calibrate global Earth degassing estimates. While many data exist on CH4 emissions from ecosystems, agricultural soils and landfills, few estimates of CH4 emissions from volcanic-geothermal areas have been performed. The authors report results and discuss applications of accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CH4 and CO2 flux from Solfatara of Pozuoli (Naples), Vulcano Island and Poggio dell'Olivo (Viterbo) volcanic-geothermal areas, and the Palma Campania landfill (Naples). Volcanic-geothermal study areas are characterised by vent discharges of fluids with different CH4/CO2 ratios (from 4.7×10-5 to 7.5×10-5, 4.7×10-4 and 2.5×10-3 by weight, for Solfatara of Pozzuoli, Vulcano island, and Poggio dell'Olivo areas, respectively). Soil CH4 fluxes range from 0.003 to 48 g m-2 day-1 in the volcanic-geothermal areas and from 0.0021 to 936 g m-2 day-1 in the landfill, with high spatial variability observed in all areas. Using statistical methods different flux populations were distinguished (i.e. background soil gases and deeply derived gases) and the total gas emissions from study sites calculated. The results of this work show that CH4/CO2 ratios of deep fluids, fumarolic fluids in the case of the volcanic-geothermal environment and biogas in landfills, are roughly maintained in the gas phase diffusely degassed by the soil. Due to high spatial variability, a large number of flux measurements and appropriate statistical methods are needed to estimate total gas discharge from study areas. Furthermore, the simultaneous measurement of diffuse CH4 and CO2 fluxes represents a strong constraint for interpretative models of deep processes associated with soil degassing. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Closed (non-steady state) chambers are widely used for quantifying carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes between soils or low-stature canopies and the atmosphere. It is well recognised that covering a soil or vegetation by a closed chamber inherently disturbs the natural CO 2 fluxes by al-tering the concentration gradients between the soil, the veg-etation and the overlying air. Thus, the driving factors of CO 2 fluxes are not constant during the closed chamber ex-periment, and no linear increase or decrease of CO 2 con-centration over time within the chamber headspace can be expected. Nevertheless, linear regression has been applied for calculating CO 2 fluxes in many recent, partly influential, studies. This approach has been justified by keeping the clo-sure time short and assuming the concentration change over time to be in the linear range. Here, we test if the application of linear regression is really appropriate for estimating CO 2 fluxes using closed chambers over short closure times and if the application of nonlinear regression is necessary. We de-veloped a nonlinear exponential regression model from dif-fusion and photosynthesis theory. This exponential model was tested with four different datasets of CO 2 flux measure-ments (total number: 1764) conducted at three peatlands sites in Finland and a tundra site in Siberia.

Kutzbach (kutzbach@uni-greifswald.de) lution in the chamber headspace and estimation of the initial CO 2 fluxes at closure time for the majority of experiments. However, a rather large percentage of the exponential regres-sion functions showed curvatures not consistent with the the-oretical model which is considered to be caused by viola-tions of the underlying model assumptions. Especially the effects of turbulence and pressure disturbances by the cham-ber deployment are suspected to have caused unexplainable curvatures. CO 2 flux estimates by linear regression can be as low as 40{\%} of the flux estimates of exponential regression for closure times of only two minutes. The degree of under-estimation increased with increasing CO 2 flux strength and was dependent on soil and vegetation conditions which can disturb not only the quantitative but also the qualitative eval-uation of CO 2 flux dynamics. The underestimation effect by linear regression was observed to be different for CO 2 uptake and release situations which can lead to stronger bias in the daily, seasonal and annual CO 2 balances than in the individ-ual fluxes. To avoid serious bias of CO 2 flux estimates based on closed chamber experiments, we suggest further tests us-ing published datasets and recommend the use of nonlinear regression models for future closed chamber studies.},

abstract = {The closed chamber technique is widely used to measure the exchange of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from terrestrial ecosystems. There is, however, large uncertainty about which model should be used to calculate the gas flux from the measured gas concentrations. Due to experimental uncertainties the robust linear regression model (first order polynomial) is often applied, even though theoretical considerations of the technique suggest the application of other, curvilinear models. High-resolution automatic chamber systems which sample gas concentrations several hundred times per flux measurement make it possible to resolve the curvilinear behavior and study the information imposed by the natural variability of the temporal concentration changes. We used more than 50 000 such flux measurements of CH4 and CO2 from five field sites located in peat forming wetlands to calculate fluxes with different models. The flux differences from independent linear estimates are generally found to be smaller than the local flux variability on the plot scale. The curvilinear behavior of the gas concentrations within the chamber is strongly influenced by wind driven chamber leakage, and less so by changing gas concentration gradients in the soil during chamber closure. Such physical processes affect both gas species equally, which makes it possible to isolate biochemical processes affecting the gases differently, such as photosynthesis limitation by chamber headspace CO2 concentrations under high levels of incoming solar radiation. We assess the possibility to exploit this effect for a partitioning of the net CO2 flux into photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration and argue that high-resolution automatic chamber measurements could be used for purposes beyond the estimation of the net gas flux.},

abstract = {Landscape position, grazing, and seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature create spatial and temporal variability in soil processes, and plant biomass and composition in grasslands. However, it is unclear how this variation in plant and soil properties affects carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of grazing, topographic position, and seasonal variation in soil moisture and temperature on plant assimilation, shoot and soil respiration, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). Carbon dioxide fluxes, vegetation, and environmental variables were measured once a month inside and outside long-term ungulate exclosures in hilltop (dry) to slope bottom (mesic) grassland throughout the 2004 growing season in Yellowstone National Park. There was no difference in vegetation properties and CO2 fluxes between the grazed and the ungrazed sites. The spatial and temporal variability in CO2 fluxes were related to differences in aboveground biomass and total shoot nitrogen content, which were both related to variability in soil moisture. All sites were CO2 sinks (NEE{\textgreater}0) for all our measurements taken throughout the growing season; but CO2 fluxes were four- to fivefold higher at sites supporting the most aboveground biomass located at slope bottoms, compared to the sites with low biomass located at hilltops or slopes. The dry sites assimilated more CO2 per gram aboveground biomass and stored proportionally more of the gross-assimilated CO2 in the soil, compared to wet sites. These results indicate large spatio-temporal variability of CO2 fluxes and suggest factors that control the variability in Yellowstone National Park.},

abstract = {Direct measurement of present day CH4 diffuse degassing from the soil represents an effective tool to better estimate the degassing rate of individual sources and to calibrate global Earth degassing estimates. While many data exist on CH4 emissions from ecosystems, agricultural soils and landfills, few estimates of CH4 emissions from volcanic-geothermal areas have been performed. The authors report results and discuss applications of accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CH4 and CO2 flux from Solfatara of Pozuoli (Naples), Vulcano Island and Poggio dell'Olivo (Viterbo) volcanic-geothermal areas, and the Palma Campania landfill (Naples). Volcanic-geothermal study areas are characterised by vent discharges of fluids with different CH4/CO2 ratios (from 4.7×10-5 to 7.5×10-5, 4.7×10-4 and 2.5×10-3 by weight, for Solfatara of Pozzuoli, Vulcano island, and Poggio dell'Olivo areas, respectively). Soil CH4 fluxes range from 0.003 to 48 g m-2 day-1 in the volcanic-geothermal areas and from 0.0021 to 936 g m-2 day-1 in the landfill, with high spatial variability observed in all areas. Using statistical methods different flux populations were distinguished (i.e. background soil gases and deeply derived gases) and the total gas emissions from study sites calculated. The results of this work show that CH4/CO2 ratios of deep fluids, fumarolic fluids in the case of the volcanic-geothermal environment and biogas in landfills, are roughly maintained in the gas phase diffusely degassed by the soil. Due to high spatial variability, a large number of flux measurements and appropriate statistical methods are needed to estimate total gas discharge from study areas. Furthermore, the simultaneous measurement of diffuse CH4 and CO2 fluxes represents a strong constraint for interpretative models of deep processes associated with soil degassing. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many wells (6900; 16{\%}) were fractured less than a mile from the surface, and 2600 wells (6{\%}) were fractured above 3000 ft (900 m), particularly in Texas (850 wells), California (720), Arkansas (310), and Wyoming (300). Average water use per well nationally was 2,400,000 gallons (9,200,000 L), led by Arkansas (5,200,000 gallons), Louisiana (5,100,000 gallons), West Virginia (5,000,000 gallons), and Pennsylvania (4,500,000 gallons).

Results showed that the annual average water volumes used per well in most of these states ranged between 1000 m3 and 30,000 m3.

abstract = {Unconventional oil and gas development has generated intense public concerns about potential impacts to groundwater quality. Specific pathways of contamination have been identified; however, overall rates of contamination remain ambiguous. We used an archive of geochemical data collected from 1988 to 2014 to determine the sources and occurrence of groundwater methane in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of northeastern Colorado. This 60,000-km2 region has a 60-y-long history of hydraulic fracturing, with horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing beginning in 2010. Of 924 sampled water wells in the basin, dissolved methane was detected in 593 wells at depths of 20–190 m. Based on carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes and gas molecular ratios, most of this methane was microbially generated, likely within shallow coal seams. A total of 42 water wells contained thermogenic stray gas originating from underlying oil and gas producing formations. Inadequate surface casing and leaks in production casing and wellhead seals in older, vertical oil and gas wells were identified as stray gas migration pathways. The rate of oil and gas wellbore failure was estimated as 0.06{\%} of the 54,000 oil and gas wells in the basin (lower estimate) to 0.15{\%} of the 20,700 wells in the area where stray gas contamination occurred (upper estimate) and has remained steady at about two cases per year since 2001. These results show that wellbore barrier failure, not high-volume hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells, is the main cause of thermogenic stray gas migration in this oil- and gas-producing basin.},

abstract = {A stratified adaptive sampling plan was designed to estimate CO2 degassing in Yellowstone National Park and was applied in the Mud Volcano thermal area. The stratified component of the sampling design focused effort in thermal areas and the adaptive component in high-flux regions, yet neither sampling technique biased the estimate of total degassing. Both diffuse soil fluxes (up to ∼30,000 g m−2d−1) and emission rates from thermal vents (up to 1.7×108 mol yr−1) were measured in thermal areas. Soil fluxes observed in most nonthermal regions were similar to values reported for conifer forests (≤ 15 g m−2 d−1). However, through adaptive sampling, high-flux vegetated sites were identified in Mud Volcano that likely would not have been found if sampling was focused in obvious thermal or altered regions. A simple model applied to flux measurements suggests that ∼40{\%} of the analyzed measurements were dominated by possible advective transport and ∼30{\%} by diffusive transport. Isotopic signatures of soil CO2 generally suggest a deep origin ($\delta$13C = −2.3 to 0.0) in thermal areas and biogenic origin ($\delta$13C = −20.5) in nonthermal, low-flux areas. Vent emissions accounted for ∼32–63{\%} of the total degassing observed at Mud Volcano (2.4 to 4.0×109 mol yr−1). The largest source of error in the estimation of total degassing (factor of ∼2) resulted because the population distribution of thermal feature emissions was indeterminate. Total CO2 emissions at Mud Volcano are comparable to other hydrothermal regions worldwide, suggesting that the Yellowstone volcanic system is likely a large contributor to global volcanic/metamoohic/hydrothermal (VMH) emissions. },

abstract = {Corporate social responsibility has received an increasing amount of attention from practitioners and scholars alike in recent years. However, very little is known about whether or how corporate social responsibility affects employees. Because employees are primary stakeholders who directly contribute to the success of the company, understanding employee reactions to corporate social responsibility may help answer lingering questions about the potential effects of corporate social responsibility on firms as well as illuminate some of the processes responsible for them. To begin our chapter, we provide a brief history of scholarship on corporate social responsibility and highlight some of the major challenges researchers in this area currently face. We then discuss why corporate social responsibility may represent a special opportunity to influence employees' general impression of their company. Next, we identify four distinct paths through which corporate social responsibility may affect employees' relationship with their company that correspond to four universal psychological needs: security, self-esteem, belongingness, and a meaningful existence. Finally, we offer an agenda for micro-level research on corporate social responsibility. Contents},

Therefore, understanding the environmental implications of producing electricity from coal is an important component of any plan to reduce total emissions and resource consumption. A life cycle assessment (LCA) on the production of electricity from coal was performed in order to examine the environmental aspects of current and future pulverized coal boiler systems. Three systems were examined: (1) a plant that represents the average emissions and efficiency of currently operating coal-fired power plants in the US (this tells us about the status quo), (2) a new coal-fired power plant that meets the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), and (3) a highly advanced coal-fired power plant utilizing a low emission boiler system (LEBS).},

abstract = {The globally-averaged atmospheric methane abundance determined from an extensive network of surface air sampling sites was constant at {\~{}}1751 ppb from 1999 through 2002. Assuming that the methane lifetime has been constant, this implies that during this 4-year period the global methane budget has been at steady state. We also observed a significant decrease in the difference between northern and southern polar zonal annual averages of CH4 from 1991 to 1992. Using a 3-D transport model, we show that this change is consistent with a decrease in CH4 emissions of {\~{}}10 Tg CH4 from north of 50N in the early-1990s. This decrease in emissions may have accelerated the global methane budget towards steady state. Based on current knowledge of the global methane budget and how it has changed with time, it is not possible to tell if the atmospheric methane burden has peaked, or if we are only observing a persistent, but temporary pause in its increase.},

abstract = {This analysis evaluates the emissions footprint of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) technology, including production and delivery stages upstream and downstream of the NGCC facility. The stages include: fuel acquisition and transportation, the conversion of the fuel to energy, and finally the delivery of the energy to the customer. Also included in the study are the raw material and energy requirements. Additionally the energy cost contributions from each of these stages has been evaluated. The analysis examines two NGCC energy conversion cases with two natural gas supply scenarios. One case assumes that the NGCC facility emits the full amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from the combustion of the fuel, the second case builds upon the first case by adding CO2 removal capability to remove 90{\%} of the CO2 from the facility flue gas. The case that captures 90{\%} of the CO2 includes the additional capture equipment, compression equipment, pipeline and injection well materials and energy requirements. The two natural gas supply scenarios include imported and domestic scenarios. As modeled in this analysis, imported natural gas is transported as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Trinidad and Tobago to the U.S., and domestic natural gas is a mix of five extraction technologies currently employed in the U.S.},

abstract = {In the later part of the 1990s, a large die-off of desert shrubs occurred over an approximately 1 km2 area in the northwestern section of the Dixie Valley (DV) geothermal field. This paper reports results from accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CO2 flux from locations in the dead zone and stable isotope and chemical data on fluids from fumaroles, shallow wells, and geothermal production wells within and adjacent to the dead zone. A cumulative probability plot shows three types of flux sites within the dead zone: Locations with a normal background CO2 flux (7 g m-2 day-1); moderate flux sites displaying "excess" geothermal flux; and high flux sites near young vents and fumaroles. A maximum CO2 flux of 570 g m-2 day-1 was measured at a location adjacent to a fumarole. Using statistical methods appropriate for lognormally distributed populations of data, estimates of the geothermal flux range from 7.5 t day-1 from a 0.14-km2 site near the Stillwater Fault to 0.1 t day-1 from a 0.01 -km2 location of steaming ground on the valley floor. Anomalous CO2 flux is positively correlated with shallow temperature anomalies. The anomalous flux associated with the entire dead zone area declined about 35{\%} over a 6-month period. The decline was most notable at a hot zone located on an alluvial fan and in the SG located on the valley floor. Gas geochemistry indicates that older established fumaroles along the Stillwater Fault and a 2-year-old vent in the lower section of the dead zone discharge a mixture of geothermal gases and air or gases from air-saturated meteoric water (ASMW). Stable isotope data indicate that steam from the smaller fumaroles is produced by ??? 100??C boiling of these mixed fluids and reservoir fluid. Steam from the Senator fumarole (SF) and from shallow wells penetrating the dead zone are probably derived by 140??C to 160??C boiling of reservoir fluid. Carbon-13 isotope data suggest that the reservoir CO2 is produced mainly by thermal decarbonation of hydrothermal calcite in veins that cut reservoir rocks. Formation of the dead zone is linked to the reservoir pressure decline caused by continuous reservoir drawdown from 1986 to present. These reservoir changes have restricted flow and induced boiling in a subsurface hydrothermal outflow plume extending from the Stillwater Fault southeast toward the DV floor. We estimate that maximum CO2 flux in the upflow zone along the Stillwater Fault in 1998 was roughly seven to eight times greater than the pre-production flux in 1986. The eventual decline in CO2 flux reflects the drying out of the outflow plume. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Diffuse emissions of CO 2 are known to be large around some volcanoes and hydrothermal areas. Accumulation-chamber measurements of CO 2 flux are increasingly used to estimate the total magmatic or metamorphic CO 2 released from such areas. To assess the performance of accumulation chamber systems at fluxes one to three orders of magnitude higher than normally encountered in soil respiration studies, a test system was constructed in the laboratory where known fluxes could be maintained through dry sand. Steady-state gas concentration profiles and fractionation effects observed in the 30-cm sand column nearly match those predicted by the Stefan-Maxwell equations, indicating that the test system was functioning successfully as a uniform porous medium. Eight groups of investigators tested their accumulation chamber equipment, all configured with continuous infrared gas analyzers (IRGA), in this system. Over a flux range of {\~{}} 200-12,000 g m -2 day -1, 90{\%} of their 203 flux measurements were 0-25{\%} lower than the imposed flux with a mean difference of - 12.5{\%}. Although this difference would seem to be within the range of acceptability for many geologic investigations, some potential sources for larger errors were discovered. A steady-state pressure gradient of -20 Pa/m was measured in the sand column at a flux of 11,200 g m -2 day -1. The derived permeability (50 darcies) was used in the dusty-gas model (DGM) of transport to quantify various diffusive and viscous flux components. These calculations were used to demonstrate that accumulation chambers, in addition to reducing the underlying diffusive gradient, severely disrupt the steady-state pressure gradient. The resultant diversion of the net gas flow is probably responsible for the systematically low flux measurements. It was also shown that the fractionating effects of a viscous CO 2 efflux against a diffusive influx of air will have a major impact on some important geochemical indicators, such as N 2/Ar, $\delta$ 15N-N 2, and 4He/ 22Ne.

abstract = {A soil gas survey for radon (Rn), thoron (Tn), CO 2, and mercury (Hg), and the chemical analysis of hot spring waters, were undertaken in the Ungaran geothermal field, Central Java, Indonesia. The results of soil gas surveys indicate fault systems trending NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE. Particularly high CO 2 concentrations ({\textgreater}20{\%}), and high Hg concentrations were detected in vicinity of the fumaroles. Emanometries of Rn, Tn and CO 2 also conclusively identified the presence of a fracture zone for the migration of geothermal fluid. The Hg results infer that the up-flow zone of high temperature geothermal fluids maybe located in the north of fumaroles in the Gedongsongo area (near the collapse wall). Chemistry of thermal springs in the up-flow zone are acid (pH=4) and show a Ca-Mg-SO 4 composition. The thermal waters are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO 3 and Ca-(Na)-SO 4-HCO 3 types near the fumarolic area and are mixed Na-(Ca)-Cl-(HCO 3) waters in the south east of Gedongsongo. The ?? 18O (between -5.3 and -8.2???) and ?? (between -39 and -52???) indicate that the waters are essentially meteoric in origin. A conceptual hydro-geochemical model of the Gedongsongo thermal waters based on the soil gas, isotope and chemical analytical results, was constructed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Noncondensible gases from hot springs, fumaroles, and deep wells within the Valles caldera geothermal system (210-300??C) consist of roughly 98.5 mo1{\%} CO2, 0.5 mol{\%} H2S, and 1 mol{\%} other components. 3He/4He ratios indicate a deep magmatic source (R/Ra up to 6) whereas ??13C-CO2 values (-3 to -5???) do not discriminate between a mantle/magmatic source and a source from subjacent, hydrothermally altered Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Regional gases from sites within a 50-km radius beyond Valles caldera are relatively enriched in CO2 and He, but depleted in H2S compared to Valles gases. Regional gases have R/Ra values ???1.2 due to more interaction with the crust and/or less contribution from the mantle. Carbon sources for regional CO2 are varied. During 1982-1998, repeat analyses of gases from intracaldera sites at Sulphur Springs showed relatively constant CH4, H2, and H2S contents. The only exception was gas from Footbath Spring (1987-1993), which experienced increases in these three components during drilling and testing of scientific wells VC-2a and VC-2b. Present-day Valles gases contain substantially less N2 than fluid inclusion gases trapped in deep, early-stage, post-caldera vein minerals. This suggests that the long-lived Valles hydrothermal system (ca. 1 Myr) has depleted subsurface Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of nitrogen. When compared with gases from many other geothermal systems, Valles caldera gases are relatively enriched in He but depleted in CH4, N2 and Ar. In this respect, Valles gases resemble end-member hydrothermal and magmatic gases discharged at hot spots (Galapagos, Kilauea, and Yellowstone). Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {High-latitude ecosystems where the mean annual ground surface temperature is around or below 0°C are highly sensitive to global warming. This is largely because these regions contain vast areas of permafrost, which begins to thaw when the mean annual temperature rises above freezing. The Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab has developed a new interactive geographical information systems (GIS) model to estimate the long-term response of permafrost to changes in climate. An analytical approach is used for calculating both active layer thickness (ALT) and mean annual ground temperatures (MAGTs). When applied to long-term (decadal or longer time scale) averages, this approach shows an accuracy of ±0.2-0.4°C for MAGTs and ±0.1-0.3 m for ALT calculations. The relative errors do not exceed 32{\%} for ALT calculations, but typically they are between 10 and 25{\%}. A spatial statistical analysis of the data from 32 sites in Siberia indicated a confidence level of 75{\%} to have a deviation between measured and calculated MAGTs of 0.2-0.4°C. A detailed analysis has been performed for two regional transects in Alaska and eastern Siberia that has validated the use of the model. The results obtained from this analysis show that a more economical (in terms of computational time) analytical approach could be successfully used instead of a full-scale numerical model in the regional and global scale analysis of permafrost spatial and temporal dynamics. This project has been a successful contribution to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment project. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

We compare the models' predictions to observations of active layer thickness, air 9 temperature, and soil temperature, and to theoretically-expected relationships between ac- 10 tive layer thickness and air temperature annual mean and seasonal cycle amplitude. Models 11 show a wide range of current permafrost areas, active layer statistics (cumulative distribu- 12 tions, correlations with mean annual air temperature and amplitude of seasonal air temper- 13 ature cycle), and ability to accurately model the coupling between soil and air temperatures 14 at high latitudes. Many of the between-model differences can be traced to differences in the 15 coupling between either near-surface air and shallow soil temperatures, or between shallow 16 and deeper (1m) soil temperatures, which in turn reflect differences in snow physics and soil 17 hydrology. We compare the models to observational datasets to benchmark the permafrost- 18 relevant physics of the models.

abstract = {Two methods are used to estimate CO2 degassing from the Yellowstone magmatic-hydrothermal system. The amount of magmatic CO2 released as basaltic magma emplaces from the mantle into the crust beneath the Yellowstone caldera is calculated and compared to CO2 fluxes measured in three different types of hydrothermal regions within Yellowstone. Comparison of modeled estimates with surface measurements suggests that 3.7 ± 1.3 × 1011 mol y−1 (45 ± 16 kt d−1) of CO2 are released from Yellowstone due to diffuse degassing. Flux measurements suggest that the diffuse flux in acid-sulfate regions is significant in total calculations ({\textgreater}96{\%} of the total), whereas the diffuse flux in neutral-chloride and travertine-precipitating areas is not significant. Analyses of carbon and helium isotopes suggest that ∼50{\%} of the CO2 emitted is derived from sedimentary sources at locations outside the caldera, whereas locations inside the caldera likely have sedimentary contributions {\textless}30{\%}. In addition to release of CO2 with emplacement, magma crystallization in the subsurface is thought to contribute significantly to the CO2 emissions at the surface. The contribution of CO2 from Yellowstone to global volcanic CO2 emissions (∼6–7 × 1012 mol y−1) is comparable to the CO2 contribution from other large volcanic systems like Popocatepetl, Mexico and the combined contribution from the Hawaii hot spot. Likewise, the amount of CO2 emitted per land area from Yellowstone (on average 108 mol CO2 km−2 y−1) is comparable to other large volcanic and hydrothermal systems worldwide.},

abstract = {In recent years, shale gas formations have become economically viable through the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These techniques carry potential environmental risk due to their high water use and substantial risk for water pollution. Using probability bounds analysis, we assessed the likelihood of water contamination from natural gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale. Probability bounds analysis is well suited when data are sparse and parameters highly uncertain. The study model identified five pathways of water contamination: transportation spills, well casing leaks, leaks through fractured rock, drilling site discharge, and wastewater disposal. Probability boxes were generated for each pathway. The potential contamination risk and epistemic uncertainty associated with hydraulic fracturing wastewater disposal was several orders of magnitude larger than the other pathways. Even in a best-case scenario, it was very likely that an individual well would release at least 200 m3 of contaminated fluids. Because the total number of wells in the Marcellus Shale region could range into the tens of thousands, this substantial potential risk suggested that additional steps be taken to reduce the potential for contaminated fluid leaks. To reduce the considerable epistemic uncertainty, more data should be collected on the ability of industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities to remove contaminants from used hydraulic fracturing fluid.},

abstract = {The closed-chamber method is the most common approach to determine CH4 fluxes in peatlands. The concentration change in the chamber is monitored over time, and the flux is usually calculated by the slope of a linear regression function. Theoretically, the gas exchange cannot be constant over time but has to decrease, when the concentration gradient between chamber headspace and soil air decreases. In this study, we test whether we can detect this non-linearity in the concentration change during the chamber closure with six air samples. We expect generally a low concentration gradient on dry sites (hummocks) and thus the occurrence of exponential concentration changes in the chamber due to a quick equilibrium of gas concentrations between peat and chamber headspace. On wet (flarks) and sedge-covered sites (lawns), we expect a high gradient and near-linear concentration changes in the chamber. To evaluate these model assumptions, we calculate both linear and exponential regressions for a test data set (n??=??597) from a Finnish mire. We use the Akaike Information Criterion with small sample second order bias correction to select the best-fitted model. 13.6{\%}, 19.2{\%} and 9.8{\%} of measurements on hummocks, lawns and flarks, respectively, were best fitted with an exponential regression model. A flux estimation derived from the slope of the exponential function at the beginning of the chamber closure can be significantly higher than using the slope of the linear regression function. Non-linear concentration-over-time curves occurred mostly during periods of changing water table. This could be due to either natural processes or chamber artefacts, e.g. initial pressure fluctuations during chamber deployment. To be able to exclude either natural processes or artefacts as cause of non-linearity, further information, e.g. CH4 concentration profile measurements in the peat, would be needed. If this is not available, the range of uncertainty can be substantial. We suggest to use the range between the slopes of the exponential regression at the beginning and at the end of the closure time as an estimate of the overall uncertainty. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper defines the climatic and environmental conditions that determine the limits and continuity of permafrost occurrence, in the Canadian context. The analysis utilizes a functional model that links air, surface and permafrost temperature through seasonal surface transfer functions and subsurface thermal properties. The temperature of permafrost (TTOP) results from the interplay between the air temperature, the nival (snow) offset and the thermal offset. These offset values vary systematically and geographically with freezing and thawing indices, snow cover conditions and ground thermal properties. These effects are analysed by calculating offset and TTOP values using Canadian climate station data for air temperature and snowfall. Whilst permafrost is ultimately a climatic phenomenon, the ground thermal conductivity ratio, via the thermal offset, is shown to be the critical factor in determining the southernmost extent of (discontinuous) permafrost. In contrast, snow cover, via the nival offset, is the critical factor in determining the northern limit of discontinuous permafrost (i.e. southern limit of continuous permafrost). Calculated TTOP values increase gradually southwards towards the limit of permafrost occurrence, as the effect of a rising mean annual air temperature (MAAT) is counteracted by an increasing thermal offset. This results in a diffuse geographical transition in the disappearance of permafrost. In contrast, there is a more abrupt transition to continuous permafrost at the northern limit of the discontinuous zone, associated with geographical changes in snow cover and the associated nival offset. The transition from discontinuous to continuous permafrost occurs between a MAAT of -6° to -8°C. This may explain the air temperature limit for continuous permafrost cited by previous authors.

---Permafrost and Climate---
- Snow cover is usually cited as the principal source of temperature difference between the air and the ground
- Thermal offset
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Observations show that when the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) is roughly -4C, the mean annual surface temp (MAGST) is roughly 0-1C, thus leading one to believe that MAATs {\textgreater} 5C would not lead to perfrost... but this is not so
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This is because the seasonal variations in the thermal properties of the ground cause the ground to be colder than MAGST 

----Climate-Permafrost System----
- Permafrost has been largely considered and reported in qualitative means
- In attempt to consider this system quantitatively, one must be congnizant of the following:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} air temp measured at standard height above snow
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} MAGST
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP)
- Low thermal condutivity of snow restricts heat loss during the winter
- Vegetation reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface in the summer
-Smith and Riseborugh (1998) shows that nf is smaller with increasing MAAT, which shows snow cover has a greaer effect on MAGST at warmer MAATs (See figure 4)
- There is a decline in ground temp during the winter is affected by snow cover
- Freeze-back: prevents the gournd from becoming cold until the active layer is completely refrozen},

@article{Huang2007,
abstract = {A stochastic response surface method (SRSM) which has been previously proposed for problems dealing only with random variables is extended in this paper for problems in which physical properties exhibit spatial random variation and may be modeled as random fields. The formalism of the extended SRSM is similar to the spectral stochastic finite element method (SSFEM) in the sense that both of them utilize Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion to represent the input, and polynomial chaos expansion to represent the output. However, the coefficients in the polynomial chaos expansion are calculated using a probabilistic collocation approach in SRSM. This strategy helps us to decouple the finite element and stochastic computations, and the finite element code can be treated as a black box, as in the case of a commercial code. The collocation-based SRSM approach is compared in this paper with an existing analytical SSFEM approach, which uses a Galerkin-based weighted residual formulation, and with a black-box SSFEM approach, which uses Latin Hypercube sampling for the design of experiments. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the features of the extended SRSM and to compare its efficiency and accuracy with the existing analytical and black-box versions of SSFEM. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A model's purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value of information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, in terms of both deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006 "The reader sees not only how measure theory is used to develop probability theory, but also how probability theory is used in applications. a The discourse is delivered in a theorem proof format and thus is better suited for classroom a .

(Peter C. Kiessler, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 102 (479), 2007) "The book is a well written self-contained textbook on measure and probability theory. It consists of 18 chapters. Every chapter contains many well chosen examples and ends with several problems related to the earlier developed theory (some with hints). a At the very end of the book there is an appendix collecting necessary facts from set theory, calculus and metric spaces.

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes.

abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that in the coming decades the United States' natural gas (NG) demand for electricity generation will increase. Estimates also suggest that NG supply will increasingly come from imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). Additional supplies of NG could come domestically from the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) via coal gasification- methanation. The objective of this study is to compare greenhouse gas (GHG), SO x , and NO life-cycle emissions x of electricity generated with NG/LNG/SNG and coal. This life-cycle comparison of air emissions from different fuels can help us better understand the advantages and disadvantages of using coal versus globally sourced NG for electricity generation. Our estimates suggest that with the current fleet of power plants, a mix of domestic NG, LNG, and SNG would have lower GHG emissions than coal. If advanced technologies with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) are used, however, coal and a mix of domestic NG, LNG, and SNG would have very similar life- cycle GHG emissions. For SO x and NO we find there are x significant emissions in the upstream stages of the NG/ LNG life-cycles, which contribute to a larger range in SO x and NO emissions for NG/LNG than for coal and SNG.},

The stages include: fuel acquisition and transportation, the conversion of the fuel to energy, and finally the delivery of the energy to the customer. Also included in the study are the raw material and energy requirements. Additionally the energy cost contributions from each of these stages has been evaluated. The analysis examines two NGCC energy conversion cases with two natural gas supply scenarios. One case assumes that the NGCC facility emits the full amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from the combustion of the fuel, the second case builds upon the first case by adding CO2 removal capability to remove 90{\%} of the CO2 from the facility flue gas. The case that captures 90{\%} of the CO2 includes the additional capture equipment, compression equipment, pipeline and injection well materials and energy requirements. The two natural gas supply scenarios include imported and domestic scenarios. As modeled in this analysis, imported natural gas is transported as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Trinidad and Tobago to the U.S., and domestic natural gas is a mix of five extraction technologies currently employed in the U.S.},

abstract = {Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enhanced energy production but raised concerns about drinking-water contamination and other environmental impacts. Identifying the sources and mechanisms of contamination can help improve the environmental and economic sustainability of shale-gas extraction. We analyzed 113 and 20 samples from drinking-water wells overlying the Marcellus and Barnett Shales, respectively, examining hydrocarbon abundance and isotopic compositions (e.g., C2H6/CH4, delta(13)C-CH4) and providing, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive analyses of noble gases and their isotopes (e.g., (4)He, (20)Ne, (36)Ar) in groundwater near shale-gas wells. We addressed two questions. (i) Are elevated levels of hydrocarbon gases in drinking-water aquifers near gas wells natural or anthropogenic? (ii) If fugitive gas contamination exists, what mechanisms cause it? Against a backdrop of naturally occurring salt- and gas-rich groundwater, we identified eight discrete clusters of fugitive gas contamination, seven in Pennsylvania and one in Texas that showed increased contamination through time. Where fugitive gas contamination occurred, the relative proportions of thermogenic hydrocarbon gas (e.g., CH4, (4)He) were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.01) and the proportions of atmospheric gases (air-saturated water; e.g., N2, (36)Ar) were significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.01) relative to background groundwater. Noble gas isotope and hydrocarbon data link four contamination clusters to gas leakage from intermediate-depth strata through failures of annulus cement, three to target production gases that seem to implicate faulty production casings, and one to an underground gas well failure. Noble gas data appear to rule out gas contamination by upward migration from depth through overlying geological strata triggered by horizontal drilling or hydraulic fracturing.},

An analysis of 75,505 compliance reports for 41,381 conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania drilled from January 1, 2000-December 31, 2012, was performed with the objective of determining complete and accurate statistics of casing and cement impairment. Statewide data show a sixfold higher incidence of cement and/or casing issues for shale gas wells relative to conventional wells. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate risk of impairment based on existing data. The model identified both temporal and geographic differences in risk. For post-2009 drilled wells, risk of a cement/casing impairment is 1.57-fold [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) (1.45, 1.67); P {\textless} 0.0001] higher in an unconventional gas well relative to a conventional well drilled within the same time period. Temporal differences between well types were also observed and may reflect more thorough inspections and greater emphasis on finding well leaks, more detailed note taking in the available inspection reports, or real changes in rates of structural integrity loss due to rushed development or other unknown factors. Unconventional gas wells in northeastern (NE) Pennsylvania are at a 2.7-fold higher risk relative to the conventional wells in the same area. The predicted cumulative risk for all wells (unconventional and conventional) in the NE region is 8.5-fold [95{\%} CI (7.16, 10.18); P {\textless} 0.0001] greater than that of wells drilled in the rest of the state.},

abstract = {Determining where and when to invest resources during and after a disruption can challenge policy makers and homeland security officials. Two decision models, one static and one dynamic, are proposed to determine the optimal resource allocation to facilitate the recovery of impacted industries after a disruption where the objective is to minimize the production losses due to the disruption. The paper presents necessary conditions for optimality for the static model and develops an algorithm that finds every possible solution that satisfies those necessary conditions. A deterministic branch-and-bound algorithm solves the dynamic model and relies on a convex relaxation of the dynamic optimization problem. Both models are applied to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which adversely impacted several industries in the Gulf region, such as fishing, tourism, real estate, and oil and gas. Results demonstrate the importance of allocating enough resources to stop the oil spill and clean up the oil, which reduces the economic loss across all industries. These models can be applied to different homeland security and disaster response situations to help governments and organizations decide among different resource allocation strategies during and after a disruption. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

- Decision Context: BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Officials need to be informed about how to make the right decisions on how to allocate resources after a disruption like an oil spill 
- This papers contributes to operations in disaster management by: 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) modeling the allocation of resources effectively 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 2) decision making with a focus on post-disruption scenarios that minimize harmful impacts and maximize recovery 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 3) to assist policy makers who are required to make decisions as the problem progresses, the authors created a discrete-time *dynamic* model in addition to a static model 
  
----Literature Review---- 
- Engineering Risk Management: maximize reliability and minimize failure 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Two-period model: present two different objectives over two different time periods (Dillon et al 2003, Dillion et al 2005 [dynamic]) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Game theory is also used in allocating resources for homeland security (Haimes et al 2008) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Dynamic resource allocation models allow the distribution of resources at different points in time 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These models do not focus on money but rather on the distribution of resources such as a machine or instrument that will help to achieve the completion of the job 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} More often used in epidemiology than in disaster management 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} {\textgreater} Psaraftis and Ziogas (1985) and Srinivasa and Wilhelm (1997) present dynamic allocation models specific to oil spoils, specifically about the equipment needed to properly clean up an oil spill 
- However, this paper will analyze post-spill decision making 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The discrete-time dynamic model in this study assumes infinitely divisible resources (continuous?) and the model uses a branch-and-bound (?) algorithm 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The constraint on resources is described as one constraint for the entire time period as opposed to a budget constraint for each time component (like in other dynamic models) 
  
----Resource allocation models---- 
Inoperability Input-Output Model 
- Two models for resource allocation - static {\&} dynamic 
- Production losses: 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) Direct: consumers reducing their demand or inoperable facilities as a result of the disruption 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 2) Indirect: losses that are a result of firms that depend on other firms that are suffering direct losses (e.g. factory in Japan loses profitability because the nuclear power plant got disrupted because of the 2011 tsunami) 
- Interdependence is an important factor considered in this model since there are multiple moving parts 
- This paper uses an Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Disruption impacts m industries out of a total of n industries 
Model 1: Static allocation 
- Total budget = Z 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Budget per industry (i = 1 through m) = z{\_}i 
- The model assumes the allocating reduces impacts exponentially
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} As more resources are allocated to an industry, the impact on the industry reduces at a constant rate - thus each additional dollar invested is less beneficial towards risk reduction than the previous dollar spent

Petroleum and gas reservoirs are the deep sources, and faults and fractured rocks serve as main pathways of degassing to the atmosphere. Violent gas emissions or eruptions are generally related to seismic activity. The global emission of methane from onshore mud volcanoes has recently been improved thanks to new experimental data sets acquired in Europe and Azerbaijan. The global estimate of microseepage can be now improved on the basis of new flux data and a more precise assessment of the global area in which microseepage may occur. Despite the uncertainty of the various source strengths, the global geological methane flux is clearly comparable to or higher than other sources or sinks considered in the tables of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change},

One well at the site experienced a blowout in late October 2015 and began leaking gas until it was sealed in February 2016. Over the course of 13 flights in the region, Conley et al. sampled the air column and determined daily release rates of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) and ethane throughout the leak. The methane release rates were nearly double that of the entire Los Angeles region combined. Thus, single vulnerabilities can have major implications for state and federal climate policy.Science, this issue p. 1317Single-point failures of natural gas infrastructure can hamper methane emission control strategies designed to mitigate climate change. The 23 October 2015 blowout of a well connected to the Aliso Canyon underground storage facility in California resulted in a massive release of natural gas. Analysis of methane and ethane data from dozens of plume transects, collected during 13 research-aircraft flights between 7 November 2015 and 13 February 2016, shows atmospheric leak rates of up to 60 metric tons of methane and 4.5 metric tons of ethane per hour. At its peak, this blowout effectively doubled themethane emission rate of the entire Los Angeles basin and, in total, released 97,100 metric tons of methane to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {In this study, we identify and characterize known and new environmental consequences associated with CO2 capture from power plants, transport by pipeline and storage in geological formations. We have reviewed (analogous) environmental impact assessment procedures and scientific literature on carbon capture and storage (CCS) options. Analogues include the construction of new power plants, transport of natural gas by pipelines, underground natural gas storage (UGS), natural gas production and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. It is investigated whether crucial knowledge on environmental impacts is lacking that may postpone the implementation of CCS projects. This review shows that the capture of CO2 from power plants results in a change in the environmental profile of the power plant. This change encompasses both increase and reduction of key atmospheric emissions, being: NOx, SO 2, NH3, particulate matter, Hg, HF and HCl. The largest trade-offs are found for the emission of NOx and NH3 when equipping power plants with post-combustion capture. Synergy is expected for SO2 emissions, which are low for all power plants with CO2 capture. An increase in water consumption ranging between 32{\%} and 93{\%} and an increase in waste and by-product creation with tens of kilotonnes annually is expected for a large-scale power plant (1 GWe), but exact flows and composition are uncertain. The cross-media effects of CO2 capture are found to be uncertain and to a large extent not quantified. For the assessment of the safety of CO2 transport by pipeline at high pressure an important knowledge gap is the absence of validated release and dispersion models for CO2 releases. We also highlight factors that result in some (not major) uncertainties when estimating the failure rates for CO 2 pipelines. Furthermore, uniform CO2 exposure thresholds, detailed dose-response models and specific CO2 pipeline regulation are absent. Most gaps in environmental information regarding the CCS chain are identified and characterized for the risk assessment of the underground, non-engineered, part of the storage activity. This uncertainty is considered to be larger for aquifers than for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Failure rates are found to be heavily based on expert opinions and the dose-response models for ecosystems or target species are not yet developed. Integration and validation of various sub-models describing fate and transport of CO2 in various compartments of the geosphere is at an infant stage. In conclusion, it is not possible to execute a quantitative risk assessment for the non-engineered part of the storage activity with high confidence. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The rise of shale gas development through horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing has expanded oil and gas exploration in the USA. The rapid rate of shale gas exploration has triggered an intense public debate regarding the potential environmental and human health effects. A review of the updated literature has identified four potential risks for impacts on water resources: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow aquifers near shale gas sites; (2) contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and disposal of inadequately treated wastewater or hydraulic fracturing fluids; (3) accumulation of toxic and radioactive residues in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) over-extraction of water resources for drilling and hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages and conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. As part of a long-term research on the potential water contamination associated with shale gas development, new geochemical and isotopic techniques have been developed for delineating the origin of gases and contaminants in water resource. In particular, multiple geochemical and isotopic (carbon isotopes in hydrocarbons, noble gas, strontium, boron, radium isotopes) tracers have been utilized to distinguish between naturally occurring dissolved gas and salts in water and contamination directly induced from shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations.},

abstract = {In response to a series of "energy crises" in the 1970s, the United States government began investigating the potential of unconventional, domestic sources of energy to offset imported oil. Hydraulic fracturing applied to vertical tight sand and coal bed methane wells achieved some degree of success during a period of high energy prices in the early 1980s, but shale gas remained largely untapped until the late 1990s with the application of directional drilling, a mature technology adapted from deepwater offshore platforms that allowed horizontal wells to penetrate kilometers of organic-rich shale, and staged hydraulic fracturing, which created high permeability flowpaths from the horizontal wells into a much greater volume of the target formations than previous completion methods.These new engineering techniques opened up vast unconventional natural gas and oil reserves, but also raised concerns about potential environmental impacts. These include short-term and long-term impacts to air and water quality from rig operations, potential migration of gas, fluids and chemicals through the ground, and effects on small watersheds and landscapes from roads, pads and other surface structures.Engineering risk assessment commonly uses integrated assessment models (IAMs), which define sources of risk from features, events and processes. The risk from each system element is assessed using high-fidelity models. Output from these is simplified into reduced-order models, so that a large, integrated site performance assessment can be run using the IAM. The technique has been applied to engineered systems in geologic settings for sequestering carbon dioxide, and it is also applicable to shale gas, albeit with some modifications of the various system elements.Preliminary findings indicate that shale gas well drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques are generally safe when properly applied. Incident reports recorded by state environmental agencies suggest that human error resulting from the disregard of prescribed practices is the greatest cause of environmental incidents. This can only be addressed through education, regulations and enforcement. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide will almost certainly lead to changes in global mean climate. But because--by definition--extreme events are rare, it is significantly more difficult to quantify the risk of extremes. Ensemble-based probabilistic predictions, as used in short- and medium-term forecasts of weather and climate, are more useful than deterministic forecasts using a 'best guess' scenario to address this sort of problem. Here we present a probabilistic analysis of 19 global climate model simulations with a generic binary decision model. We estimate that the probability of total boreal winter precipitation exceeding two standard deviations above normal will increase by a factor of five over parts of the UK over the next 100 years. We find similar increases in probability for the Asian monsoon region in boreal summer, with implications for flooding in Bangladesh. Further practical applications of our techniques would be helped by the use of larger ensembles (for a more complete sampling of model uncertainty) and a wider range of scenarios at a resolution adequate to analyse average-size river basins.},

abstract = {Tectonically stable deep saline reservoirs are considered to be the most abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration sites. Pressure, temperature, salinity and other characteristics of these geologic formations vary at each injection site. It is essential to understand the roles of geologic and engineering factors to optimize the CO2 injection conditions and to quantify the associated risks. Factors such as the magnitude of injection-induced reservoir pressure, quantity of supercritical phase CO2 that comes in contact with caprock, and the amount of residually trapped CO2 govern the fate of CO2, and provide quantitative assessment of the storage integrity.A streamlined protocol was developed using response surface methodology to quantify the risks related to CO2 injection. The proposed methodology includes the design of simulation scenarios, selection and screening of parameters, multiple-linear regression of outcomes, and the development of probability density functions (PDF) of various potential risk factors. Multiphase numerical simulations were performed to understand the behavior of the injected CO2 and associated parameters in deep saline reservoirs with prescribed geometries and petrophysical properties. Formation thickness, formation depth, porosity, horizontal permeability, brine density, and the end-point residual CO2 saturation were the six critical parameters identified that affected important outcomes. A six-factor Box-Behnken experimental design procedure was used to establish an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters on the important factors, and for subsequently establishing response surfaces. Closed boundary domains with different operational constraints were employed. A stepwise, sequential regression method was used to determine statistically significant coefficients of a response surface model. Monte Carlo simulations with logical distributions of input parameters were performed using the response surface coefficients. Uncorrelated and correlated porosity-permeability distributions were used to generate two types of probability density functions (PDF). PDFs of CO2 plume extent under the caprock and average reservoir overpressure after injection were generated given all of the variability in the input parameters. These results will allow initial screening of a large number of potential injection sites without detailed simulations of each. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article analyzes possible terrorist attacks on the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach using a radiological dispersal device (RDD, also known as a "dirty bomb") to shut down port operations and cause substantial economic and psychological impacts. The analysis is an exploratory investigation of a combination of several risk analysis tools, including scenario generation and pruning, project risk analysis, direct consequence modeling, and indirect economic impact assessment. We examined 36 attack scenarios and reduced them to two plausible or likely scenarios using qualitative judgments. For these two scenarios, we conducted a project risk analysis to understand the tasks terrorists need to perform to carry out the attacks and to determine the likelihood of the project's success. The consequences of a successful attack are described in terms of a radiological plume model and resulting human health and economic impacts. Initial findings suggest that the chances of a successful dirty bomb attack are about 10-40{\%} and that high radiological doses are confined to a relatively small area, limiting health effects to tens or at most hundreds of latent cancers, even with a major release. However, the economic consequences from a shutdown of the harbors due to the contamination could result in significant losses in the tens of billions of dollars, including the decontamination costs and the indirect economic impacts due to the port shutdown. The implications for countering a dirty bomb attack, including the protection of the radiological sources and intercepting an ongoing dirty bomb attack are discussed.},
annote = {----Introduction----
- The authors attempt to answer the following question in the context of producing a risk and econ analysis of LA and Long Beach:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) WHat are the threats?
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 2) If an attack was successful, what might be the economic and health impacts?
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 3) What are possible recomendations that can made using this publication's analysis?

----Sources of Radioactive Material----
- 2 million licensed sealed sources are in use for the US
- 15 member states of the Euro Union report that there are 500E03 sealed sources have been located

----2.1 | Nuclear Reactor {\&} Waste Facilities----
- Nuclear material is pretty well protected in the US but is suspected to be poor in other countries (not much evidence cited here)

----2.2 | Medical, Research, and Industrial Facilities----
- Sources of radiation from radiotherpy instruments pose a security risk
- Sterilization processes that make use of radioactive material have short half-lives so the security risk is low 
- Industrial facilities that use food irradiators pose the greatest risk in this category because they can contain millions of curies
- Other industrial applications that use radiation (e.g. well logging) come under less scrutiny by the NRC than with other sources

----2.3 | Foreign Sources of Radioactive Material----
- Sources from the previous USSR pose a security risk
- Radioactive thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are in need of dismantlement and hold potentially millions of curies

----3 | Senarios and Probabilities----
- Ports are ideal targets for terrorists attacks because of their importance to the economy and their role as a nexus for transportation make them difficult to protect
- This study analyzed LA and Long Beach harbors because they handle a combined value of 295B USD worth of goods
- This study explored:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} the danger of the varying sources of radioactive material and ...
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} the differences in attackes when ther material originates from domestic as opposed to international locations
- Three scenarios were considered for the attack:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Low radioactivity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Medium radioactivity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} High radioactivity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Each scenario was attached to four transportation modes (truck, ship, train, and plane/helicopter) and 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} three types of locations (bridge, harbor-elevated, and harbor-ground)
**For a total of 36 possible attack scenrios**
----3.1 | Type of Bomb Constructed----
- The authors focus on athe medium scenarion in this publication 
- The authors anticipate that the dirty bomb would disperse anywhere from minor amounts to large amounts that sorb to partiles in the air 
---- 3.2 | Delivery Methods----
- These ports can be reached by land, air, and sea
----3.3 | Delivery Methods-----
- Terrorists will select a method that has a low probability of detection but also maximizes damage
- The mode of transportation depends on the size and type of the bomb
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Size ranges from a suitcase to a van
----3.4 | Pruning Scnarios and Assessing Relative Likelihoods----
- radioactive source x transportation mode x delivery location

----4 | Consequences----
- Three main categories of consequences:
1) Immediate fatalities and injuries 
2) Medium- and long-term effects
3) Economic radioactive material
- In the medium radioactivity scenario, 5-30{\%} of the material was released as aerosols (500-30000 curies)},

The ?? 13C values of CH 4 and C 2H 6 for the majority of thermogenic gases from water wells either matched or were between values for the samples of non-native storage-field gas from injection wells and the samples of gas from storage-field observation wells. Traces of C 2H 6 with microbial CH 4 and a range of C and H isotopic compositions of CH 4 indicate gases of different origins are mixing in sub-surface pathways; gas mixtures are present in groundwater. Pathways for gas migration and a specific source of the gases were not identified. Processes responsible for the presence of microbial gases in groundwater could be elucidated with further geochemical study. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The increasing number of studies on the determination of natural methane in groundwater of shale gas prospection areas offers a unique opportunity for refining the quantification of natural methane emissions. Here methane emissions, computed from four potential sources, are reported for an area of ca. 16,500km2 of the St. Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec (Canada), where Utica shales are targeted by the petroleum industry. Methane emissions can be caused by 1) groundwater degassing as a result of groundwater abstraction for domestic and municipal uses; 2) groundwater discharge along rivers; 3) migration to the surface by (macro- and micro-) diffuse seepage; 4) degassing of hydraulic fracturing fluids during first phases of drilling. Methane emissions related to groundwater discharge to rivers (2.47??10-4 to 9.35??10-3 Tgyr-1) surpass those of diffuse seepage (4.13??10-6 to 7.14??10-5 Tgyr-1) and groundwater abstraction (6.35??10-6 to 2.49??10-4 Tgyr-1). The methane emission from the degassing of flowback waters during drilling of the Utica shale over a 10- to 20-year horizon is estimated from 2.55??10-3 to 1.62??10-2 Tgyr-1. These emissions are from one third to sixty-six times the methane emissions from groundwater discharge to rivers. This study shows that different methane emission sources need to be considered in environmental assessments of methane exploitation projects to better understand their impacts.},

abstract = {Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are transforming energy production, but their potential environmental effects remain controversial. We analyzed 141 drinking water wells across the Appalachian Plateaus physiographic province of northeastern Pennsylvania, examining natural gas concentrations and isotopic signatures with proximity to shale gas wells. Methane was detected in 82{\%} of drinking water samples, with average concentrations six times higher for homes {\textless}1 km from natural gas wells (P = 0.0006). Ethane was 23 times higher in homes {\textless}1 km from gas wells (P = 0.0013); propane was detected in 10 water wells, all within approximately 1 km distance (P = 0.01). Of three factors previously proposed to influence gas concentrations in shallow groundwater (distances to gas wells, valley bottoms, and the Appalachian Structural Front, a proxy for tectonic deformation), distance to gas wells was highly significant for methane concentrations (P = 0.007; multiple regression), whereas distances to valley bottoms and the Appalachian Structural Front were not significant (P = 0.27 and P = 0.11, respectively). Distance to gas wells was also the most significant factor for Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (P {\textless} 0.01). For ethane concentrations, distance to gas wells was the only statistically significant factor (P {\textless} 0.005). Isotopic signatures ($\delta$(13)C-CH4, $\delta$(13)C-C2H6, and $\delta$(2)H-CH4), hydrocarbon ratios (methane to ethane and propane), and the ratio of the noble gas (4)He to CH4 in groundwater were characteristic of a thermally postmature Marcellus-like source in some cases. Overall, our data suggest that some homeowners living {\textless}1 km from gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of methane (CH4) emissions using atmospheric observations from thirteen sites in California during June 2013 – May 2014. A hierarchical Bayesian inversion method is used to estimate CH4 emissions for spatial regions (0.3° pixels for major regions) by comparing measured CH4 mixing ratios with transport model (WRF-STILT) predictions based on seasonally varying California-specific CH4 prior emission models. The transport model is assessed using a combination of meteorological and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements coupled with the gridded California Air Resources Board (CARB) CO emission inventory. The hierarchical Bayesian inversion suggests that state annual anthropogenic CH4 emissions are 2.42 ± 0.49 Tg CH4/yr (at 95{\%} confidence), higher (1.2 - 1.8 times) than the current CARB inventory (1.64 Tg CH4/yr in 2013). It should be noted that undiagnosed sources of errors or uncaptured errors in the model-measurement mismatch covariance may increase these uncertainty bounds beyond that indicated here. The CH4 emissions from the Central Valley and urban regions (San Francisco Bay and South Coast Air Basins) account for {\~{}}58{\%} and 26{\%} of the total posterior emissions, respectively. This study suggests that the livestock sector is likely the major contributor to the state total CH4 emissions, in agreement with CARB's inventory. Attribution to source sectors for sub-regions of California using additional trace gas species would further improve the quantification of California's CH4 emissions and mitigation efforts towards the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB-32).},

abstract = {RATIONALE: The carbon and hydrogen isotopes of methane are useful in differentiating biological (e.g. wetlands, ruminants, biomass burning) and geological methane sources (e.g. fossil fuels, gas hydrates), as well as quantifying pathways of methanotrophism. Continuous-flow isotopic measurements of methane present a set of analytical challenges, including sample size restrictions and separation of CH4 from atmosphere, hydrocarbons, and CO2 .$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Small-scale modifications were made to a commercial trace-gas preconcentration and sampling unit (Thermo Scientific PreCon-GasBench) for improved isotopic analysis of methane ($\delta$(13)C/$\delta$(2)H) across a range of gas concentrations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The long-term reproducibility of $\delta$(13)C-CH4 values is less than ±0.2‰ (1$\sigma$). The limit-of-quantitation of $\delta$(13)C-CH4 values is less than 0.8 nmol, conveniently measurable within standard gas sampling vials. A reproducibility of better than ±4‰ (1$\sigma$) is regularly achieved for $\delta$(2) H values from sample sizes greater than 2 nmol. The range of measurement, for both $\delta$(13)C and $\delta$(2)H values, is easily extended from ambient concentration ({\~{}}1.7 ppm-v) for preconcentrated samples to percent methane concentrations under subsampling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The automated measurement of $\delta$(13)C-CH4 and $\delta$(2)H-CH4 values, from ambient to percentage concentrations, is possible with minimal modifications to a commercial preconcentration/gas chromatography inlet. Sample matrix interferences (CO2 , Cn Hy , air) are eliminated and simultaneous isotopic measurements of methane and CO2 and/or C1 -C4 light hydrocarbons are possible, while still retaining functionality for isotopic measurements of other gas species (e.g. CO2, N2, O2).},

abstract = {Abandoned oil and gas wells provide a potential pathway for subsurface migration and emissions of methane and other fluids to the atmosphere. Little is known about methane fluxes from the millions of abandoned wells that exist in the United States. Here, we report direct measurements of methane fluxes from abandoned oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania, using static flux chambers. A total of 42 and 52 direct measurements were made at wells and at locations near the wells ("controls") in forested, wetland, grassland, and river areas in July, August, October 2013 and January 2014, respectively. The mean methane flow rates at these well locations were 0.27 kg/d/well, and the mean methane flow rate at the control locations was 4.5 × 10(-6) kg/d/location. Three out of the 19 measured wells were high emitters that had methane flow rates that were three orders of magnitude larger than the median flow rate of 1.3 × 10(-3) kg/d/well. Assuming the mean flow rate found here is representative of all abandoned wells in Pennsylvania, we scaled the methane emissions to be 4-7{\%} of estimated total anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. The presence of ethane, propane, and n-butane, along with the methane isotopic composition, indicate that the emitted methane is predominantly of thermogenic origin. These measurements show that methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells can be significant. The research required to quantify these emissions nationally should be undertaken so they can be accurately described and included in greenhouse gas emissions inventories.},

abstract = {After methane, ethane is the most abundant hydrocarbon in the remote atmosphere. It is a precursor to tropospheric ozone and it influences the atmosphere/'s oxidative capacity through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical, ethane/'s primary atmospheric sink. Here we present the longest continuous record of global atmospheric ethane levels. We show that global ethane emission rates decreased from 14.3 to 11.3 teragrams per year, or by 21 per cent, from 1984 to 2010. We attribute this to decreasing fugitive emissions from ethane/'s fossil fuel source—most probably decreased venting and flaring of natural gas in oil fields—rather than a decline in its other major sources, biofuel use and biomass burning. Ethane/'s major emission sources are shared with methane, and recent studies have disagreed on whether reduced fossil fuel or microbial emissions have caused methane/'s atmospheric growth rate to slow. Our findings suggest that reduced fugitive fossil fuel emissions account for at least 10-21 teragrams per year (30-70 per cent) of the decrease in methane/'s global emissions, significantly contributing to methane/'s slowing atmospheric growth rate since the mid-1980s.},

abstract = {The recent increase of atmospheric methane is investigated by using two atmospheric inversions to quantify the distribution of sources and sinks for the 2006–2008 period, and a process-based model of methane emissions by natural wetland ecosystems. Methane emissions derived from the two inversions are consistent at a global scale: emissions are decreased in 2006 (−7 Tg) and increased in 2007 (+21 Tg) and 2008 (+18 Tg), as compared to the 1999–2006 period. The agreement on the latitudinal partition of the flux anomalies for the two inversions is fair in 2006, good in 2007, and not good in 2008. In 2007, a positive anomaly of tropical emissions is found to be the main contributor to the global emission anomalies ({\~{}}60–80{\%}) for both inversions, with a dominant share attributed to natural wetlands ({\~{}}2/3), and a significant contribution from high latitudes ({\~{}}25{\%}). The wetland ecosystem model produces smaller and more balanced positive emission anomalies between the tropics and the high latitudes for 2006, 2007 and 2008, mainly due to precipitation changes during these years. At a global scale, the agreement between the ecosystem model and the inversions is good in 2008 but not satisfying in 2006 and 2007. Tropical South America and Boreal Eurasia appear to be major contributors to variations in methane emissions consistently in the inversions and the ecosystem model. Finally, changes in OH radicals during 2006–2008 are found to be less than 1{\%} in inversions, with only a small impact on the inferred methane emissions.},

Here we quantify the influence of the El Ni{\~{n}}o{\&}{\#}8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on wetland CH4 emissions, which are thought to be the dominant contributor to interannual variability of the CH4 sources. We use a simple wetland CH4 model that captures variability in wetland extent and soil carbon to model the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetland CH4 emissions from 1950{\&}{\#}8211;2005 and compare these results to an ENSO index. We are able to explain a large fraction of the global and tropical variability in wetland CH4 emissions through correlation with the ENSO index. We find that repeated El Ni{\~{n}}o events throughout the 1980s and 1990s were a contributing factor towards reducing CH4 emissions and stabilizing atmospheric CH4 concentrations. An increase in emissions from the boreal region would likely strengthen the feedback between ENSO and interannual variability in global wetland CH4 emissions.

abstract = {By comparison of the methane mixing ratio and the carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13(CH4)) in Arctic air with regional background, the incremental input of CH4 in an air parcel and the source delta C-13(CH4) signature can be determined. Using this technique the bulk Arctic CH4 source signature of air arriving at Spitsbergen in late summer 2008 and 2009 was found to be -68 parts per thousand, indicative of the dominance of a biogenic CH4 source. This is close to the source signature of CH4 emissions from boreal wetlands. In spring, when wetland was frozen, the CH4 source signature was more enriched in C-13 at -53 +/- 6 parts per thousand with air mass back trajectories indicating a large influence from gas field emissions in the Ob River region. Emissions of CH4 to the water column from the seabed on the Spitsbergen continental slope are occurring but none has yet been detected reaching the atmosphere. The measurements illustrate the significance of wetland emissions. Potentially, these may respond quickly and powerfully to meteorological variations and to sustained climate warming.

abstract = {A growing dependence on natural gas for energy may exacerbate emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Identifying fingerprints of these emissions is critical to our understanding of potential impacts. Here, we compare stable isotopic and alkane ratio tracers of natural gas, agricultural, and urban CH4 sources in the Barnett Shale hydraulic fracturing region near Fort Worth, Texas. Thermogenic and biogenic sources were compositionally distinct, and emissions from oil wells were enriched in alkanes and isotopically depleted relative to natural gas wells. Emissions from natural gas production varied in delta(13)C and alkane ratio composition, with deltaD-CH4 representing the most consistent tracer of natural gas sources. We integrated our data into a bottom-up inventory of CH4 for the region, resulting in an inventory of ethane (C2H6) sources for comparison to top-down estimates of CH4 and C2H6 emissions. Methane emissions in the Barnett are a complex mixture of urban, agricultural, and fossil fuel sources, which makes source apportionment challenging. For example, spatial heterogeneity in gas composition and high C2H6/CH4 ratios in emissions from conventional oil production add uncertainty to top-down models of source apportionment. Future top-down studies may benefit from the addition of deltaD-CH4 to distinguish thermogenic and biogenic sources.},

abstract = {A factor of 2.5 increase in the global abundance of atmospheric methane (CH(4)) since 1750 contributes 0.5 Wm(-2) to total direct radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases (2.77 Wm(-2) in 2009), while its role in atmospheric chemistry adds another approximately 0.2 Wm(-2) of indirect forcing. Since CH(4) has a relatively short lifetime and it is very close to a steady state, reductions in its emissions would quickly benefit climate. Sensible emission mitigation strategies require quantitative understanding of CH(4)'s budget of emissions and sinks. Atmospheric observations of CH(4) abundance and its rate of increase, combined with an estimate of the CH(4) lifetime, constrain total global CH(4) emissions to between 500 and 600 Tg CH(4) yr(-1). While total global emissions are constrained reasonably well, estimates of emissions by source sector vary by up to a factor of 2. Current observation networks are suitable to constrain emissions at large scales (e.g. global) but not at the regional to national scales necessary to verify emission reductions under emissions trading schemes. Improved constraints on the global CH(4) budget and its break down of emissions by source sector and country will come from an enhanced observation network for CH(4) abundance and its isotopic composition ($\delta$(13)C, $\delta$D(D=(2)H) and $\delta$(14)C). Isotopic measurements are a valuable tool in distinguishing among various sources that contribute emissions to an air parcel, once fractionation by loss processes is accounted for. Isotopic measurements are especially useful at regional scales where signals are larger. Reducing emissions from many anthropogenic source sectors is cost-effective, but these gains may be cancelled, in part, by increasing emissions related to economic development in many parts of the world. An observation network that can quantitatively assess these changing emissions, both positive and negative, is required, especially in the context of emissions trading schemes.},

abstract = {We present high time resolution airborne ethane (C2H6) and methane (CH4) measurements made in March and October 2013 as part of the Barnett Coordinated Campaign over the Barnett Shale formation in Texas. Ethane fluxes are quantified using a downwind flight strategy, a first demonstration of this approach for C2H6. Additionally, ethane-to-methane emissions ratios (C2H6:CH4) of point sources were observationally determined from simultaneous airborne C2H6 and CH4 measurements during a survey flight over the source region. Distinct C2H6:CH4 × 100{\%} molar ratios of 0.0{\%}, 1.8{\%}, and 9.6{\%}, indicative of microbial, low-C2H6 fossil, and high-C2H6 fossil sources, respectively, emerged in observations over the emissions source region of the Barnett Shale. Ethane-to-methane correlations were used in conjunction with C2H6 and CH4 fluxes to quantify the fraction of CH4 emissions derived from fossil and microbial sources. On the basis of two analyses, we find 71-85{\%} of the observed methane emissions quantified in the Barnett Shale are derived from fossil sources. The average ethane flux observed from the studied region of the Barnett Shale was 6.6 ± 0.2 × 10(3) kg hr(-1) and consistent across six days in spring and fall of 2013.},

abstract = {A global climatological distribution of tropospheric OH is computed using observed distributions of O3, H2O, NOt (NO2 +NO + 2N2O5 + NO3 + HNO2 +HNO4), CO, hydrocarbons, temperature, and cloud optical depth. Global annual mean OH is 1.16×106 molecules cm-3 (integrated with respect to mass of air up to 100 hPa within ±32° latitude and up to 200 hPa outside that region). Mean hemispheric concentrations of OH are nearly equal. While global mean OH increased by 33{\%} compared to that from Spivakovsky et al. [1990], mean loss frequencies of CH3CCl3 and CH4 increased by only 23{\%} because a lower fraction of total OH resides in the lower troposphere in the present distribution. The value for temperature used for determining lifetimes of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by scaling rate constants [Prather and Spivakovsky, 1990] is revised from 277 K to 272 K. The present distribution of OH is consistent within a few percent with the current budgets of CH3CCl3 and HCFC-22. For CH3CCl3, it results in a lifetime of 4.6 years, including stratospheric and ocean sinks with atmospheric lifetimes of 43 and 80 years, respectively. For HCFC-22, the lifetime is 11.4 years, allowing for the stratospheric sink with an atmospheric lifetime of 229 years. Corrections suggested by observed levels of CH2Cl2 (annual means) depend strongly on the rate of interhemispheric mixing in the model. An increase in OH in the Northern Hemisphere by 20{\%} combined with a decrease in the southern tropics by 25{\%} is suggested if this rate is at its upper limit consistent with observations of CFCs and 85Kr. For the lower limit, observations of CH2Cl2 imply an increase in OH in the Northern Hemisphere by 35{\%} combined with a decrease in OH in the southern tropics by 60{\%}. However, such large corrections are inconsistent with observations for 14CO in the tropics and for the interhemispheric gradient of CH3CCl3. Industrial sources of CH2Cl2 are sufficient for balancing its budget. The available tests do not establish significant errors in OH except for a possible underestimate in winter in the northern and southern tropics by 15-20{\%} and 10-15{\%}, respectively, and an overestimate in southern extratropics by ˜25{\%}. Observations of seasonal variations of CH3CCl3, CH2Cl2, 14CO, and C2H6 offer no evidence for higher levels of OH in the southern than in the northern extratropics. It is expected that in the next few years the latitudinal distribution and annual cycle of CH3CCl3 will be determined primarily by its loss frequency, allowing for additional constraints for OH on scales smaller than global.},

abstract = {A recent paper by Tans [1997] has drawn attention to the isotopic disequilibrium that inevitably prevails when atmospheric methane is not in steady state with its sources, noting in particular the very slow adjustment of the isotopic signature $\delta$13C toward its steady state. Our aim in this paper is to clarify the nature of disequilibrium effects on $\delta$13C(CH4) and to assess their likely magnitudes in the global atmosphere over recent decades. We use a simple model simulation incorporating a plausible scenario of the global methane source history over 1700–2010, which includes an unchanged source since 1990. The simulation of both mixing ratio and $\delta$13C compare favorably with the secular features of a 10-year data set (1988–1998) from Baring Head, New Zealand, and of a 17-year data set (1978–1995) in air archived from Cape Grim, Australia. This corroborates a recent analysis of those data sets and their compatibility with stabilized sources. We show that the slow adjustment of $\delta$13C toward steady state arises from the effect of isotope fractionation on the cancellation of contributing terms to $\delta$13C. We explore the implications of disequilibrium for the usual practice of relating $\delta$13C values in the atmosphere to those in the aggregate source through a shift induced by fractionation and quantify the flaws in this practice. Finally, we examine the sensitivity of the atmospheric secular response, in both mixing ratio and $\delta$13C, to sustained changes in source and sink and show that $\delta$13C is a potentially powerful diagnostic of such changes.},

abstract = {Atmospheric methane (CH4) increased from ∼900 ppb (parts per billion, or nanomoles per mole of dry air) in 1900 to ∼1800 ppb in 2010 at a rate unprecedented in any observational records. However, the contributions of the various methane sources and sinks to the CH4 in- crease are poorly understood. Here we use initial emissions from bottom-up inventories for anthropogenic sources, emis- sions from wetlands and rice paddies simulated by a ter- restrial biogeochemical model, and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM)-based chemistry-transport model (i.e. ACTM) to simulate atmospheric CH4 concentrations for 1910–2010. The ACTM simulations are compared with the CH4 concentration records reconstructed from Antarc- tic and Arctic ice cores and firn air samples, and from di- rect measurements since the 1980s at multiple sites around the globe. The differences between ACTM simulations and observed CH4 concentrations are minimized to optimize the global total emissions using a mass balance calculation. Dur- ing 1910–2010, the global total CH4 emission doubled from ∼290 to ∼580 Tgyr−1. Compared to optimized emission, the bottom-up emission data set underestimates the rate of change of global total CH4 emissions by ∼30{\%} during the high growth period of 1940–1990, while it overestimates by ∼380{\%} during the low growth period of 1990–2010. Fur- ther, using the CH4 stable carbon isotopic data ($\delta$13C), we at- tribute the emission increase during 1940–1990 primarily to enhancement of biomass burning. The total lifetime of CH4 shortened from 9.4 yr during 1910–1919 to 9 yr during 2000– 2009 by the combined effect of the increasing abundance of atomic chlorine radicals (Cl) and increases in average air temperature. We show that changes of CH4 loss rate due to increased tropospheric air temperature and CH4 loss due to Cl in the stratosphere are important sources of uncertainty to more accurately estimate the global CH4 budget from $\delta$13C observations.},

abstract = {Observations at surface sites show an increase in global mean surface methane (CH4) of about 180 parts per billion (ppb) (above 10 {\%}) over the period 1984–2012. Over this period there are large fluctuations in the annual growth rate. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric CH4 evolution over the period 1970–2012 with the Oslo CTM3 global chemical transport model (CTM) in a bottom-up approach. We thoroughly assess data from surface measurement sites in international networks and select a subset suited for comparisons with the output from the CTM. We compare model results and observations to understand causes for both long-term trends and short-term variations. Employing Oslo CTM3 we are able to reproduce the seasonal and year-to-year variations and shifts between years with consecutive growth and stagnation, both at global and regional scales. The overall CH4 trend over the period is reproduced, but for some periods the model fails to reproduce the strength of the growth. The model overestimates the observed growth after 2006 in all regions. This seems to be explained by an overly strong increase in anthropogenic emissions in Asia, having global impact. Our findings confirm other studies questioning the timing or strength of the emission changes in Asia in the EDGAR v4.2 emission inventory over recent decades. The evolution of CH4 is not only controlled by changes in sources, but also by changes in the chemical loss in the atmosphere and soil uptake. The atmospheric CH4 lifetime is an indicator of the CH4 loss. In our simulations, the atmospheric CH4 lifetime decreases by more than 8 {\%} from 1970 to 2012, a significant reduction of the residence time of this important greenhouse gas. Changes in CO and NOx emissions, specific humidity, and ozone column drive most of this, and we provide simple prognostic equations for the relations between those and the CH4 lifetime. The reduced lifetime results in substantial growth in the chemical CH4 loss (relative to its burden) and dampens the CH4 growth.},

The threshold level happens to coincide with the aquifer boundary for sufficiently high unit cost of pumping, in which case, only the runoff water of excess recharge should be collected.},

It is implicit in the classification of aquifer units according to their vulnerabil- ity to pollution. The management of both groundwater resources and of individual groundwater sources cannot sensibly be undertaken without some knowledge of recharge: its quantity, its seasonality and, above all, the different routes through the sub-soil and the unsaturated zone by which it can occur. However, current estimates of recharge, other than on a research site basis, may be poor, both in the UK and overseas. This volume pro- vides a review of current research into these issues; this introductory paper attempts to high- light the thread throughout all of this work which collectively provides the basic information in support of the current and future management of groundwater resources and sources.},

abstract = {The calibration of a groundwater model with the aid of hydrochemical data has demonstrated that low recharge rates in the Middle Rio Grande Basin may be responsible for a groundwater trough in the center of the basin and for a substantial amount of Rio Grande water in the regional flow system. Earlier models of the basin had difficulty reproducing these features without any hydrochemical data to constrain the rates and distribution of recharge. The objective of this study was to use the large quantity of available hydrochemical data to help calibrate the model parameters, including the recharge rates. The model was constructed using the US Geological Survey's software MODFLOW, MODPATH, and UCODE, and calibrated using 14C activities and the positions of certain flow zones defined by the hydrochemical data. Parameter estimation was performed using a combination of nonlinear regression techniques and a manual search for the minimum difference between field and simulated observations. The calibrated recharge values were substantially smaller than those used in previous models. Results from a 30,000-year transient simulation suggest that recharge was at a maximum about 20,000 years ago and at a minimum about 10,000 years ago.},

Hydrochemical zones, representing groundwater flow over thousands to tens of thousands of years, can be traced over large distances through the primarily siliciclastic aquifer system. The locations of the hydrochemical zones mostly reflect the "modern" predevelopment hydraulic-head distribution, but are inconsistent with a trough in predevelopment water levels in the west-central part of the basin, indicating that this trough is a transient rather than a long-term feature of the aquifer system. Radiocarbon ages adjusted for geochemical reactions, mixing, and evapotranspiration/dilution processes in the aquifer system were nearly identical to the unadjusted radiocarbon ages, and ranged from modern to more than 30 ka. Age gradients from piezometer nests ranged from 0.1 to 2 year cm(-1) and indicate a recharge rate of about 3 cm year(-1) for recharge along the eastern mountain front and infiltration from the Rio Grande near Albuquerque.

abstract = {Quantitative evaluations of the impact of groundwater abstraction on recharge are rare. Over a period (1975–2007) during which groundwater abstraction increased dramatically in the Bengal Basin, changes in net groundwater recharge in Bangladesh are assessed using the water-table fluctuation method. Mean annual groundwater recharge is shown to be higher (300–600mm) in northwestern and southwestern areas of Bangladesh than in southeastern and northeastern regions ({\textless}100mm) where rainfall and potential recharge are greater. Net recharge in many parts of Bangladesh has increased substantially (5– 15mm/year between 1985 and 2007) in response to increased groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies. In contrast, net recharge has slightly decreased (−0.5 to −1mm/year) in areas where groundwater- fed irrigation is low ({\textless}30{\%} of total irrigation) and where abstraction has either decreased or remained unchanged over the period of 1985–2007. The spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge in Bangladesh illustrate the fundamental flaw in definitions of “safe yield” based on recharge estimated under static (non-pumping) conditions and reveal the areas where (1) further groundwater abstraction may increase actual recharge to the shallow aquifer, and (2) current groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies is unsustainable.},

Currently, the basin is in the third year of severe drought; irrigation and municipal water diversions have been severely curtailed; extensive diversions threaten endangered species, and reservoir volumes are nearly depleted. A central challenge is development of policies that efficiently and equitably allocate the basin's water resources among competing uses across political and institutional jurisdictions. A basin-wide, nonlinear programming model optimizes resource allocations and water use levels for the upper part of the Rio Grande Basin to test whether institutional adjustments can reduce damages caused by drought. Compared to existing institutions, we find that future drought damages could be reduced by 20 and 33{\%} per year through intracompact and interstate water markets, respectively, that would allow water transfers across water management jurisdictions. Results reveal economic tradeoffs among water uses, regions, and drought control strategies.},

@article{Grande2004,
abstract = {This research is developing a distributed, dynamical model for esti- mating recharge and partitioning water budgets across the climatic and topog- raphic gradients of the Rio Grande in southern Colorado and New Mexico. The present paper focuses on formulation of finite-volume balance equations and their physical basis; the relation of the model to qualitative characteristics of cli- mate, vegetation and hydrogeologic conditions; and discretization of the model using the natural coordinates of the terrain. Explicit expressions are developed which link the upward and downward flux of water below the root zone (re- charge and evapotranspiration respectively) to the water table position and the in- teraction of groundwater with ephemeral and perennial streamflow. The model- ing strategy, originally proposed by Duffy (1996) for soil moisture and ground- water flow at the hillslope scale, is extended here to the case where major changes in terrain, climate, vegetation and hydrogeologic conditions require a distributed, but low-dimensional, water balance. The complexity or dimension of the model is determined by the choice of support scale of the geospatial data (e.g. terrain, climate, landuse, and vegetation features) and the corresponding relation of the subsurface contributing area to surface streams or ephemeral channels. The model approach is based on a semi-discrete finite volume method, where the par- tial differential equations are formed in terms of a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The model is demonstrated for a mountain-front setting in central New Mexico, the Llano de Sandia. A simulation scenario ex- plores the long range impacts of abrupt climate change on upland recharge and riparian evapotranspiration through gains and losses of groundwater to the Rio Grande},

Objective: response of large rivers to atmospheric forcing
- Modeling Strategy 01: discrete and numerical solutions to assiciated PDEs in 4D space-time
- Modeling Strategy 02: spatially averaged equations for the purpose over a specified scale
- Modeling Strategy 03 (Focus of this paper): Semi-discrete method that uses equations that are discrete in space and continuous

Physical Conceptual Framework
- Winter snowpack and meltwater composes the majority of the water in the Rio Grande Basin (RGB) for the spring recharge. and the thunderstorms of the late summer also contribute to water for recharge
- Annual percip at high elevations: 50 cm yr-1
- Annual precip at low elevations: {\textless} 20 cm yr-1
- One author (Phillips 1994) shows that there may not be recharge at low elevatins and there may actually be a small upward flow, a normal process at low eleveations},

abstract = {High-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) has revolutionized the oil and gas industry worldwide but has been accompanied by highly controversial incidents of reported water contamination. For exam- ple, groundwater contamination by stray natural gas and spillage of brine and other gas drilling-related fluids is known to occur. However, contamination of shallow potable aquifers by HVHF at depth has never been fully documented. We investigated a case where Marcellus Shale gas wells in Pennsylvania caused inunda- tion of natural gas and foam in initially potable groundwater used by several households. With comprehensive 2D gas chromatogra- phy coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), an unresolved complexmixture of organic compounds was identified in the aquifer. Similar signatures were also observed in flowback from Marcellus Shale gas wells. A compound identified in flow- back, 2-n-Butoxyethanol, was also positively identified in one of the foaming drinking water wells at nanogram-per-liter concen- trations. The most likely explanation of the incident is that stray natural gas and drilling or HF compounds were driven ∼1–3km along shallow to intermediate depth fractures to the aquifer used as a potable water source. Part of the problem may have been wastewaters from a pit leak reported at the nearest gas well pad—the only nearby pad where wells were hydraulically frac- tured before the contamination incident. If samples of drilling, pit, and HVHF fluids had been available, GCxGC-TOFMS might have fingerprinted the contamination source. Such evaluations would contribute significantly to better management practices as the shale gas industry expands worldwide.},

abstract = {The permeability of a rock fracture is controlled primarily by the geometry of its void space. One effect of void space geometry is to cause the fluid to follow a tortuous path to flow around the asperities, which are regions where the two faces of the fracture are in contact. To examine the tortuosity induced by the contact area, we consider an idealized fracture consisting of two parallel plates propped open by isolated asperities. Boundary-element calculations, analogue electrical conductivity measurements and an effective medium approximation are used to study the permeability of fractures with circular, elliptical and irregular asperity shapes. The permeability is seen to depend not only on the amount of contact area, but also on the shape of the asperities. For circular or elliptical asperities, very accurate estimates are found by using the effective medium theory proposed by Maxwell. ?? 1992.},

4.2 | Methane Sink Variation?

{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Some authors [Rigby et al (2008)] have proposed that there was a decrease in OH during 2007 suggesting that the methane increase is due to a smaller sink
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Though the authors of this publication are skeptical due to the lack of isotopic evidence

5 | Running Budget ANalysis and INterpretation of Shifts of the $\delta$13C-CH4 Record
- Regardless of the location it appears that the isotopic data shows methane is becoming isotopically lighter

5.1 | Mole Fraction Constraints
- Emissions of CH4 (avg. 1998-2014) = 560-580 Tg CH4 yr-1
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 11{\%} in the 30-90 °S region
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 27{\%} in the 00-30 °S region
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 32{\%} in the 00-30 °N region
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 30{\%} in the 30-90 °N region
- Between 2005 snd 2014, low lattitude regins (0-30°) for both hemispheres exhibited 3-6{\%} increases in methane emissions 

5.2 | Isotopic Constraints
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} -57.8‰ $\delta$13C in the 30-90 °S region
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} -53.9‰ $\delta$13C in the 00-30 °S region

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} -53.4‰ $\delta$13C in the 30-90 °N region

6 | Conclusions
- Methane emissions are increasing (3-6{\%}) and becoming more biogenic (a global decrease in $\delta$13C-CH4 of -0.17‰) over the last 12 years
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These increases seemed to have been sourced from wetland emissions
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Though the authors say they cannot rule out oil and gas development especially if the oil and gas being developed has a microbial fingerprint
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} I do not personally think this caveat fits since 20{\%} of oil and gas has a biogenic fingerprint
- The chance that this would be due to the decrease in the OH sink is unlikely due to (??)
- Schaefer et al (2016) suggests that it is possible that the increase in methane is due to agriculture developments
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These authors disagree and contend that Schaefer et al underestimate the importance of wetland emissions
- The authors claim that a likely cause for the increase and biogenic shift of methane emissions is due to sustained precipitation in the tropics},

@article{Ge1997a,
abstract = {Fluid flow in a rock fracture bounded by two irregular surfaces is complex even under a laminar how regime. The major factor causing deviation of predicted fracture flow behavior from the ideal parallel plate theory is the nature of nonparallel and nonsmooth geometry of fracture surfaces. Important questions on the validity of the cubic law and the Reynolds equation for complicated fracture geometries have been studied by many researchers. The general conclusion from these efforts is that the cubic law is valid provided that an appropriate average aperture can be defined. Many average apertures have been proposed, and for some cases, some work better than others. Nonetheless, to date, these efforts have not converged to form a unified definition on the fracture aperture needed in the cubic law, which stimulates the current effort to develop a general governing equation for fracture flow from a fundamental consideration. In this study, a governing equation stemming from the principle of mass conservation and the assumption that the cubic law holds locally is derived for incompressible laminar fluid flow in irregular fractures under steady state conditions. The equation is formulated in both local and global coordinates and explicitly incorporates two vectorial variables of fracture geometry: true aperture and tortuosity. Under the assumption of small variations in both tortuosity and aperture, the governing equation can be reduced to the Reynolds equation. Two examples are provided to show the importance and generality of the new governing equation in both local and global coordinate systems. In a simple fracture with two nonsmooth and nonparallel surfaces, the error in permeability estimation can be induced using the Reynolds equation with the apparent aperture and can reach 10{\%} for a 25 degrees inclination between the fracture surfaces. In a fracture with sinusoidal surfaces, the traditional method can cause significant errors in both permeability and pressure calculation.},

abstract = {Testing of 1701 water wells in northeastern Pennsylvania shows that methane is ubiquitous in groundwater, with higher concentrations observed in valleys vs. upland areas and in association with calcium-sodium-bicarbonate, sodium-bicarbonate, and sodium-chloride rich waters--indicating that, on a regional scale, methane concentrations are best correlated to topographic and hydrogeologic features, rather than shale-gas extraction. In addition, our assessment of isotopic and molecular analyses of hydrocarbon gases in the Dimock Township suggest that gases present in local water wells are most consistent with Middle and Upper Devonian gases sampled in the annular spaces of local gas wells, as opposed to Marcellus Production gas. Combined, these findings suggest that the methane concentrations in Susquehanna County water wells can be explained without the migration of Marcellus shale gas through fractures, an observation that has important implications for understanding the nature of risks associated with shale-gas extraction.},

abstract = {Abandoned oil and gas (AOG) wells can provide pathways for subsurface fluid migration, which can lead to groundwater contamination and gas emissions to the atmosphere. Little is known about the millions of AOG wells in the U.S. and abroad. Recently, we acquired data on methane emissions from 42 plugged and unplugged AOG wells in five different counties across western Pennsylvania. We used historical documents to estimate well depths, and used these depths with the emissions data to estimate the wells' effective permeabilities, which capture the combined effects of all leakage pathways within and around the well bores. We find effective permeabilities to range from 10-6 millidarcies to 102 millidarcies, which are within the range of previous estimates. The effective permeability data presented here provide perspective on older AOG wells and are valuable when considering the leakage potential of AOG wells in a wide range of applications including geologic storage of carbon dioxide, natural gas storage, and oil and gas development.},

abstract = {This study considered the fugitive emissions of methane (CH4) from former oil and gas exploration and production wells drilled to exploit conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs onshore in the UK. This study selected from the 66{\%} of all onshore wells in the UK which appeared to be properly decommissioned (abandoned) that came from 4 different basins and were between 8 and 79 years old. The soil gas above each well was analysed and assessed relative to a nearby control site of similar land use and soil type. The results showed that of the 102 wells considered 30{\%} had soil gas CH4 at the soil surface that was significantly greater than their respective control. Conversely, 39{\%} of well sites had significant lower surface soil gas CH4 concentrations than their respective control. We interpret elevated soil gas CH4 concentrations to be the result of well integrity failure, but do not know the source of the gas nor the route to the surface. Where elevated CH4 was detected it appears to have occurred within a decade of it being drilled. The flux of CH4 from wells was 364 ± 677 kg CO2eq/well/year with a 27{\%} chance that the well would have a negative flux to the atmosphere independent of well age. This flux is low relative to the activity commonly used on decommissioned well sites (e.g. sheep grazing), however, fluxes from wells that have not been appropriately decommissioned would be expected to be higher.},

abstract = {In floodplain environments, a naturally reduced zone (NRZ) is considered to be a common bio- geochemical hot spot, having distinct microbial and geochemical characteristics. Although important for understanding their role in mediating floodplain biogeochemical processes, mapping the subsurface distri- bution of NRZs over the dimensions of a floodplain is challenging, as conventional wellbore data are typi- cally spatially limited and the distribution of NRZs is heterogeneous. In this study, we present an innovative methodology for the probabilistic mapping of NRZs within a three-dimensional (3-D) subsurface domain using induced polarization imaging, which is a noninvasive geophysical technique. Measurements consist of surface geophysical surveys and drilling-recovered sediments at the U.S. Department of Energy field site near Rifle, CO (USA). Inversion of surface time domain-induced polarization (TDIP) data yielded 3-D images of the complex electrical resistivity, in terms of magnitude and phase, which are associated with mineral precipitation and other lithological properties. By extracting the TDIP data values colocated with wellbore lithological logs, we found that the NRZs have a different distribution of resistivity and polarization from the other aquifer sediments. To estimate the spatial distribution of NRZs, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate the geophysical and wellbore data. In addition, the resistivity images were used to esti- mate hydrostratigraphic interfaces under the floodplain. Validation results showed that the integration of electrical imaging and wellbore data using a Bayesian hierarchical model was capable of mapping spatially heterogeneous interfaces and NRZ distributions thereby providing a minimally invasive means to parame- terize a hydrobiogeochemical model of the floodplain.},

Yet, results of our literature review, including more than 10,000 articles published in 15 journals from January 2001 and December 2010, indicate that Bayesian approaches are essentially absent from the organizational sciences. Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advan- tages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

abstract = {A method for obtaining precise replicas of real fracture surfaces using transparent epoxy resins was developed, allowing detailed study of fluid flow paths within a fracture plane. A natural rock fracture was collected from the field and prepared for study. Silicon rubber molds of the fracture surfaces were used to make a transparent epoxy replica of the original fracture. Clear and dyed water were injected into the fracture pore space allowing examination of the flow field. Digitized optical images were used to observe wetting, saturated flow, and drying of the specimen. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging was used for quantitative measurements of flow velocity. Both video imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging techniques show distinct and strong channeling of the flow at the submillimeter to several-centimeter scale. Each phenomenon, including wetting, drying, dye transport, and velocity channeling, has its own distinct geometric structure and scale. We find that fluid velocities measured simultaneously at various locations in the fracture plane during steady state flow range over several orders of magnitude, with the maximum velocity a factor of 5 higher than the mean velocity. This suggests that flow channeling in fractured rock can cause the breakthrough velocity of contaminants to far exceed the mean flow.},

abstract = {The flow of a single-phase fluid through a rough-walled rock fracture is discussed within the context of fluid mechanics. The derivation of the ‘cubic law' is given as the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for flow between smooth, parallel plates - the only fracture geometry that is amenable to exact treatment. The various geometric and kinematic conditions that are necessary in order for the Navier-Stokes equations to be replaced by the more tractable lubrication or Hele-Shaw equations are studied and quantified. In general, this requires a sufficiently low flow rate, and some restrictions on the spatial rate of change of the aperture profile. Various analytical and numerical results are reviewed pertaining to the problem of relating the effective hydraulic aperture to the statistics of the aperture distribution. These studies all lead to the conclusion that the effective hydraulic aperture is less than the mean aperture, by a factor that depends on the ratio of the mean value of the aperture to its standard deviation. The tortuosity effect caused by regions where the rock walls are in contact with each other is studied using the Hele-Shaw equations, leading to a simple correction factor that depends on the area fraction occupied by the contact regions. Finally, the predicted hydraulic apertures are compared to measured values for eight data sets from the literature for which aperture and conductivity data were available on the same fracture. It is found that reasonably accurate predictions of hydraulic conductivity can be made based solely on the first two moments of the aperture distribution function, and the proportion of contact area.},

abstract = {The results of three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) and Stokes simulations and two-dimensional local cubic law (LCL) simulations of fluid flow through single rough-walled fractures are presented. Synthetic rough-walled fractures were created by combining random fields of aperture and the mean wall topography or midsurface, which quantifies undulation about the fracture plane. A finite volume formulation of the LCL that incorporates geometric corrections for fracture undulation is presented. Simulations of fluid flow through planar fractures with sinusoidal variation in aperture were compared to published results. The rough-walled fracture simulations demonstrated that the total flow rates predicted by the corrected LCL were within 10{\%} of those predicted by the Stokes equations for all the fractures examined in this work. Differences between the NS and Stokes simulations clearly demonstrated that inertial forces can significantly influence the internal flow field within a fracture and the total flow rate across a fracture. By limiting the total flow rate differences between the NS and Stokes simulations, constraints for three kinematic parameters were determined. For all the fractures presented in this work, the corrected LCL was determined to be an acceptable approximation to the NS equations, provided that the kinematic and geometric constraints were met.},
annote = {Background: 
- The literature has demonstrated that single fractures are rough-walled conduits with variable aperture and points of contact
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} A one-dimensional cubic law is not valid for predicting the fluid flow when the conduits are considered rough
- Navier-Stokes equations governs the complex fluid flow

Primary Objective: 
- Compare Navier-Stokes (NS) and Stokes simulations to show how they validate the local cubic law (LCL)

Method: Random Fracture Generation
- Aperture (b) is allowed to vary throughout the fracture in the x-y plane (e.g. b(x,y))
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This means that the aperture will mirror itself along the x-y plane
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Aperture fields are normally and lognormally distributed
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Mid-surface fields are normally distributed
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Mid-surface: mean topography of the fracture walls
- Four steps for fracture generation
1) Randomly generate two independent spatially correlated standardized normal distributions over an x-y grid
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}One grid is associated with aperture e{\_}b(x,y) and midsurface e{\_}Z(x,y)
2) Transform e{\_}b field into an aperture field with specified (non-standardized) mean (b{\_}m) and standard deviation (sigma{\_}m)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Once those parameters are established, one needs to truncate the aperture field to specified contact aperture (b{\_}c)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These transformations of the aperture fields are approxiamte because aperture distributions are discrete and finite, whereas probability functions are continuous and inifinite 
3) This step transforms the standardized the e{\_}Z field to the midsurface elevation field
- The equation for this midsurface is: Z = sigma{\_}z * e{\_}Z, where Z has a mean of zero
4) This step defines the fracture walls
- It defines the upper wall by: Z{\_}U = Z + (1/2)b
- It defines the lower wall by: Z{\_}L = Z - (1/2)b
- The variation (stanard deviation) of these walls is defined by: sigma{\_}U = sigma{\_}L = [sigma{\_}Z{\^{}}2 + (1/4)sigma{\_}b{\^{}}2]{\^{}}(1/2)
- Grid Spacing: the authors chose to make a 26x26 point grid that represented a 50x50 mm space. The reasoning behind this was:
1) finest resolution used by an associated physical experiment/measurement session
2) provided a tractabke 3-D flow solution at a scale above 1cm

Governing Equations:
- The authors use Navier-Stokes (NS) equations to describe the fluid flow through a single fracture
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The fluid is considered to be steady and laminar with constant density and viscosity throughout the fracture
- The authors present three levels of simplification to the NS equations 
1) Assume all interial forces are negligibly small compared to the forces of pressure and visocity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} RHS of eqn 10 goes to zero (see eqn 13)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} However, in order for this assumption to be valid the Reynolds 
2) Approximate the 3D flow field with a 2D description
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Do this by making the assumption that flow normal to the fracture walls (Z{\_}U and Z{\_}L)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This now means that the velocity vector u = (u{\_}x, u{\_}y, 0)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} By inserting the B.C. of u = 0 at the fracture walls and integrating one achieves an average in plane velocity vector U (see equation 16), which is later combined with the viscous and pressure forces and integrated to yield the local cubic law (LCL) (see equation 18)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} It is very important that the aperture variation is gradual in order to use the LCL. The correlation length (lambda, see equation 1) (length scale of roughness) needs to be at least 50 times greater than sigma{\_}U
3) The third simplification is reduce the 2D field o a 1D description
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The flow is now considered moving unidirectionally from an inlet towards an outlet and the fracture now has two parallel plates, of which, aperature does not change along the length of the fracture L, and there is hydraulic head defined at the inlet and the outlet (see eqations 21 and 22)

Model Development
- All models in this work utilize the finite volume method to approximate the governing differential equations
- The authors defined the domain of the fracture of interest spanning a 6 x 6 nonorthognal grid
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} ... which they subdivided to a 10 x 10 x 5 (four control volumes (CVs) for each orginal section of the domain and it divides the aperture by four)},

abstract = {Single-phase flow through fractured media occurs in various situations, such as transport of dissolved contaminants through geological strata, sequestration of carbon dioxide in depleted gas reservoirs, and in primary oil recovery. In the present study, fluid flows through a rock fracture were simulated. The fracture geometry was obtained from the CT scans of a rock fracture produced by the Brazilian method in a sandstone sample. A post-processing code using a CAD package was developed and used to generate the three-dimensional fracture from the CT scan data. Several sections along the fracture were considered and the Gambit??? code was used to generate unstructured grids for flow simulations. FLUENT??? was used to analyze the flow conditions through the fracture section for different flow rates. Because of the small aperture of the fractures, the gravitational effects could be neglected. It was confirmed that the pressure drop was dominated by the smallest aperture passages of the fracture. The accuracy of parallel plate models for estimating the pressure drops through fractures was studied. It was shown that the parallel plate flow model with the use of an appropriate effective fracture aperture and inclusion of the tortuosity factor could provide reasonable estimates for pressure drops in the fracture. On the basis of the CFD simulation data, a new expression for the friction factor for flows through fractures was developed. The new model predictions were compared with the simulation results and favorable agreement was found. It was shown that when the length of the fracture and the mean and standard deviation of the fracture are known, the pressure loss as a function of the flow rate could be estimated. These findings may prove useful for design of lab experiments, computational studied of flows through real rock fractures, or inclusions in simulators for large-scale flows in highly fractured rocks. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Among the current problems that hydrogeologists face, perhaps there is none as challenging as the characterization of fractured rock (Faybishenko and Benson 2000). This paper discusses issues associated with the quantification of flow and transport through fractured rocks on scales not exceeding those typically associated with single- and multi-well pressure (or flow) and tracer tests. As much of the corresponding literature has focused on fractured crystalline rocks and hard sedimentary rocks such as sandstones, limestones (karst is excluded) and chalk, so by default does this paper. Direct quantification of flow and transport in such rocks is commonly done on the basis of fracture geometric data coupled with pressure (or flow) and tracer tests, which therefore form the main focus. Geological, geophysical and geochemical (including isotope) data are critical for the qualitative conceptualization of flow and transport in fractured rocks, and are being gradually incorporated in quantitative flow and transport models, in ways that this paper unfortunately cannot describe but in passing. The hydrogeology of fractured aquifers and other earth science aspects of fractured rock hydrology merit separate treatments. All evidence suggests that rarely can one model flow and transport in a fractured rock consistently by treating it as a uniform or mildly nonuniform isotropic continuum. Instead, one must generally account for the highly erratic heterogeneity, directional dependence, dual or multicomponent nature and multiscale behavior of fractured rocks. One way is to depict the rock as a network of discrete fractures (with permeable or impermeable matrix blocks) and another as a nonuniform (single, dual or multiple) continuum. A third way is to combine these into a hybrid model of a nonuniform continuum containing a relatively small number of discrete dominant features. In either case the description can be deterministic or stochastic. The paper contains a brief assessment of these trends in light of recent experimental and theoretical findings, ending with a short list of prospects and challenges for the future.},
annote = {Introduction
- The litrerature tends to focus on the flow and transport through fractures that are more permeable than the parent rock
- Fratured rocks need to be characterized in situ
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Packer test is the most common method for characterizing fractured rocks
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Hydrualic conductivity and permeability come from these packer tests

{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Transmissivities, permeabilities, specific storage, and storativities
- Flows through fractures (through tracer tests)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Several authors have been successful in modeling the flow through these fractures all using different models
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These results lead that there is not a specific model that can model flow and transport throuh a fractured rock consistently - especially, when treating the rock as a uniform isotropic continuum

Conceptualization of Fracture Rocks as Discrete Networks

Trends in Discrete Network Modeling
- Quality DFNs incporaete random and interconnected line segments that represent fractures
- There are two approaches to making 3D DFNs:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) Generate numerous random DFNs (hundreds to thousands of fractures) to uncover random effective parameters to subdomains of the mass of rock being investigated
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 2) Simulate flow and/or transport usiing high-res DFNs (thousands or tens of thousands of fractures)

Issues with Delineation of Discontinuties
- Data limitation: it is difficult to map discontunities, especially at a smaller scale
- Fracture density along surface outcrops are significantly less than fractures immediately below the surface (results from borehole studies)
- The author states that it is important to perform hydraulic or pneumatic tests to ensure that the fractures are properly charaterized since visual inspection of geometries is insufficient

Issues with Characteristics of Discontinuties
- Even with pneumatic tests, it is difficult to be certain that the results are isolating the fracture in question
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} There are ways around this: see Illman and Neuman (2000) and an alternative method published by Kuusela-Lahtinen et al (2003)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Using just a pneumatic/hydraulic test is possible to define fracture aperture if the tests is paired with a theoretical model (e.g. effective hydraulic aperture, see Folger et al 1999)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This is based on the cubic law
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}Which is a little problematic in the real world. Corrections for roughness and fully continuous and open fractures need to be implemented for the cubic law to be an effective tool in characterizing 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Film flow can occur in very small or large fractures and is strongly enhanced by surface roughness, the film may exceed mean velocities by multiple orders of magnitude

Dynamic Natuer of Flow Channels
- There are preferred flow paths for fluids through fractures which is determined by asperities and aperture variation throughout the fracture
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These variations in asperities and apertures have been determined by careful measurements
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Within a millimeter, the measurements of asperities and apertures may vary by orders of magnitude, thus the interest in fine resolutions
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} There exists evidence from field studies that preferred paths are present on scales larger than a single fracture
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Meaning that the intersection of fractures could play a role in creating preferred paths of flow

Implications vis-a-vis Conceptualization of Fractured Rocks as Discrete Networs
- One of the ultimate goals behind is to link the results from a DFN to larger scale processes. But the author cautions that connecting the sum of the parts to the whole may be problematic in this case
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} There has yet (as of 2003) to be a model that connects experimental/computational results to field-scale phemonolgy},

abstract = {The last 130 years of fluctuations in precipitation associated with the Southwest Monsoon(summer monsoon), Northeast Monsoon(winter monsoon), First Intermonsoon, and Second Intermonsoon seasons have been analysed at 15 climate stations in Sri Lanka. Analyses of trends in the interannual seasonal series indicated statistically significant temporal changes in Southwest-Monsoon-related precipitation at five of the stations, with three stations showing enhanced rainfall (total of 80 mm/month). The stations showing loss of rainfall are confined to higher elevation areas and those exhibiting enhanced rainfall are located in the lowlands in the southwestern sector of Sri Lanka. None of the stations show any singnificant change in Northeast Monsoon precipitation through time. Most of the stations are shown to have received significantly greater amounts of Second Intermonsoon precipitation during El Nino years. The second Intermonsoon rainfall is, on average, 70 mm/month greater during El Nino years. However, a few stations show increased Southwest Monsoon precipitation(May to September) during La Nina years. Two stations along the eastern and northern coastal areas receive, on average, between 14 and 20 mm/month more Southwest Monsoon rainfall during La Nina years than during El Nino years.},

abstract = {When fugitive methane migrates upward along boreholes of oil and gas wells, it may migrate into shallow ground water or pass through overlying soil to the atmosphere. Prior to this study, there was little information on the fate of fugitive methane that migrates into ground water. In a field study near Lloydminster, Alberta, Canada, we found hydrogeochemical evidence that fugitive methane from an oil well migrated into a shallow aquifer but has been attenuated by dissimilatory bacterial sulfate reduction at low temperature ( approximately 5 degrees C) under anaerobic conditions. Evidence includes spatial and temporal trends in concentrations of methane and sulfate in ground water and associated trends in concentrations of bicarbonate and sulfide. Within 10 m of the oil well, sulfate concentrations were low, and sulfate was enriched in both 34S and 18O. Sulfate concentrations had a strong positive correlation with delta13C values of bicarbonate, and sulfide was depleted in 34S compared to sulfate. These data indicate that bacterial sulfate reduction occurred near the production well. Near the oil well, elevated concentrations of bicarbonate were observed, and the bicarbonate was depleted in 13C. Modeling indicates that the main source of this excess 13C-depleted bicarbonate is oxidized methane. In concert with the sulfate concentration and isotope data, these results support an interpretation that in situ bacterial oxidation of methane has occurred, linked to bacterial sulfate reduction. Bacterial sulfate reduction may play a major role in bioattenuation of fugitive natural gas in ground water in western Canada.},

abstract = {Methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere, and it is an important greenhouse gas, which has so far contributed an estimated 20{\%} of postindustrial global warming. A great deal of biogeochemical research has focused on the causes and effects of the variation in global fluxes of methane throughout earth's history, but the underlying microbial processes and their key agents remain poorly understood. This is a disturbing knowledge gap because 85{\%} of the annual global methane production and about 60{\%} of its consumption are based on microbial processes. Only three key functional groups of microorganisms of limited diversity regulate the fluxes of methane on earth, namely the aerobic methanotrophic bacteria, the methanogenic archaea, and their close relatives, the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME). The ANME represent special lines of descent within the Euryarchaeota and appear to gain energy exclusively from the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), with sulfate as the final electron acceptor according to the net reaction: CH(4) + SO(42-) ---{\textgreater} HCO(3-) + HS(-) + H(2)O. This review summarizes what is known and unknown about AOM on earth and its key catalysts, the ANME clades and their bacterial partners.},

abstract = {Understanding the transport of hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluid that is injected into the deep sub- surface for shale gas extraction is important to ensure that shallow drinking water aquifers are not contami- nated. Topographically driven flow, overpressured shale reservoirs, permeable pathways such as faults or leaky wellbores, the increased formation pressure due to HF fluid injection, and the density contrast of the HF fluid to the surrounding brine can encourage upward HF fluid migration. In contrast, the very low shale permeability and capillary imbibition of water into partially saturated shale may sequester much of the HF fluid, and well production will remove HF fluid from the subsurface. We review the literature on important aspects of HF fluid migration. Single-phase flow and transport simulations are performed to quantify how much HF fluid is removed via the wellbore with flowback and produced water, how much reaches overlying aquifers, and how much is permanently sequestered by capillary imbibition, which is treated as a sink term based on a semianalytical, one-dimensional solution for two-phase flow. These simulations include all of the important aspects of HF fluid migration identified in the literature review and are performed in five stages to faithfully represent the typical operation of a hydraulically fractured well. No fracturing fluid reaches the aquifer without a permeable pathway. In the presence of a permeable pathway, 10 times more fracturing fluid reaches the aquifer if well production and capillary imbibition are not included in the model.},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing of deep shale beds to develop natural gas has caused concern regarding the potential for various forms of water pollution. Two potential pathways-advective transport through bulk media and preferential flow through fractures-could allow the transport of contaminants from the fractured shale to aquifers. There is substantial geologic evidence that natural vertical flow drives contaminants, mostly brine, to near the surface from deep evaporite sources. Interpretative modeling shows that advective transport could require up to tens of thousands of years to move contaminants to the surface, but also that fracking the shale could reduce that transport time to tens or hundreds of years. Conductive faults or fracture zones, as found throughout the Marcellus shale region, could reduce the travel time further. Injection of up to 15,000,000 L of fluid into the shale generates high pressure at the well, which decreases with distance from the well and with time after injection as the fluid advects through the shale. The advection displaces native fluids, mostly brine, and fractures the bulk media widening existing fractures. Simulated pressure returns to pre-injection levels in about 300 d. The overall system requires from 3 to 6 years to reach a new equilibrium reflecting the significant changes caused by fracking the shale, which could allow advective transport to aquifers in less than 10 years.

abstract = {Since the early 1980s the southeastern part of Turkey has experienced major land use changes because of increasing irrigation. To determine the influence of large-scale irrigation on surface hydrologic fluxes, we investigated feedback mechanisms between the land surface and atmosphere within the framework of Bouchet's complementary relationship between potential and actual evapotranspiration. Using 23 years of meteorological observations of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and radiation within the advection-aridity model (which is built on the complementary theory), we found that potential evaporation has decreased over 50{\%}, from about 14 mm d 1 to about 7 mm d 1, paralleling the increase in irrigated acreage over the same period. Pan evaporation data show a similar trend. The observed decline in potential evaporation is a direct result of decreases in wind speed and, to a lesser degree, increases in humidity. A comparison between reference values of evapotranspiration obtained from irrigation water use and evapotranspiration estimates from the advection-aridity method show a reasonable correlation (root-mean-square error = 1.1 mm d 1), especially for large values of both variables. These results suggest that the rapid expansion of irrigation in southeastern Turkey has strongly modified the lower atmosphere in a way that appears consistent with Bouchet's complementary theory.},

abstract = {The Saint-Venant equations have consistently proved capable of accurately simulating hydrographs at plot scale. However, recent works showed that even though the hydrograph is satisfyingly reproduced, the flow velocity field within the plot might be wrong, with the highest velocity largely underestimated. Moreover, the choice of roughness models to be used in the Saint-Venant equations is most often done in the purpose of increasing the hydrograph quality, while the actual travel time of water is ignored. This paper presents a tracer experiment made on a 10-m by 4-m rainfall simulation plot, where travel time and tracer mass recovery as well as local flow velocity have been measured. Four roughness models are tested: (i) Darcy-Weisbach's model, (ii) Lawrence's model, (iii) Manning's model with a constant roughness coefficient, and (iv) Manning's model with a variable roughness coefficient which decreases as a power law of the runoff water depth.Models with a constant friction factor largely underestimate high velocities. Moreover, they are not able to simulate tracer travel-times. Lawrence's model correctly simulates low and high velocities as well as tracer breakthrough curves. However, a specific set of parameters are required for each breakthrough curve from the same experiment. The best results are obtained with the Manning's model with a water-depth dependent roughness coefficient: simulated velocities are consistent with measurements, and a single set of parameters captures the entire set of breakthrough curves, as well as tracer mass recovery.The study reported here brings the following findings: (i) roughness coefficient is flow-dependent, (ii) faithful simulation of the velocity fields does not imply a good prediction of travel time and mass recovery, (iii) the best model is a Manning type model with a roughness coefficient which decreases as a power law of water depth.The full dataset used in this work is available on request. It can be used as benchmark for overland flow and transport models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study investigates how different tree species influence soil hydrological properties that are relevant for the rainfall-runoff response of a given soil type. We hypothesize that for the same soil type, tree species that differ in rooting system, water consumption and associated soil fauna and soil flora lead to different soil moisture dynamics and lateral flow processes during rainfall and hence to different runoff responses. To test this hypothesis, we compare soil moisture patterns and interflow at different soil depths in a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) forest and in a European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest during sprinkling experiments on two 6 ?? 10 m hillslope segments with the same soil type. Spruce with a shallow rooting system and sinkers that remain very shallow on poorly aerated soils and beech with a heart shaped, often deeper rooting system are two of the most important tree species in Central Europe. At each hillslope, volumetric soil water contents were measured in 6. min intervals with 48 TDR waveguides during and after sprinkling with intensities of 100. mm/h and 60. mm/h (for 1. h). The waveguides were installed in 12 soil pits, whereby a single soil pit consisted of four 20. cm buriable waveguides installed in 10 cm, 30. cm, 50. cm and 70. cm soil depth. Surface and shallow interflow at 10 cm soil depth and interflow at soil depths of 30. cm and 60. cm was automatically recorded. Despite the high rainfall intensities, no surface flow was observed in any of the experiments and only small amounts of shallow interflow were measured. Soil moisture patterns of lateral cross sections during and after the sprinkling reveal how tree species can alter runoff dynamics: under spruce, coinciding with rooting patterns, a water table develops in approximately 30. cm soil depth while the soil water content in 50 and 70. cm depth remains low. At the beech site, where coarse roots are found in deeper soil horizons, more water is directed towards deeper, already wetter soil horizons, from where the water table raises into the topsoil with high lateral conductivity. Because the higher water content on top of the stagnic layer allows segments of macropores like old root channels to connect earlier under beech, the beech hillslope exhibits a faster runoff response than the spruce hillslope. A lower water table and a higher macro-porosity makes saturation excess overland flow unlikely under beech. With the shallow water table and a lower available soil volume for preferential flow, a site planted with spruce is prone to saturation excess overland flow under natural rainfall conditions with inflow from the top. The results suggest that different tree species can lead to different rainfall-runoff responses at the same soil type. Though the study site showed minimal variation in soil properties, we cannot exclude that some of the differences in runoff processes we observed are caused by factors other than tree species, because only one large hillslope segment in each forest stand was sprinkled. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

A 1 year {\&}{\#}8220;pulse{\&}{\#}8221; experiment, with 4°C warming and a doubling in precipitation, was performed to evaluate the changes in soil moisture dynamics. Frequency distribution analyses of soil moisture and soil temperature were used to explore the consequences of climate change on ecohydrological processes at different soil depths. There was a decrease in soil moisture frequency from 0 to 120 cm in both warming and warming with increased precipitation experiments. Different soil depths had similar patterns of change in soil moisture and soil temperature frequency. Additionally, we correlated evapotranspiration and soil moisture to look at changes in evapotranspiration from the wilting point (Ew) to maximum evapotranspiration (Emax). These results revealed a shift in the slope and position of Ew to Emax with experimental warming. Our results showed that the soil moisture dynamics and the ecohydrology were changed by different global climate change scenarios. Understanding the effects of global warming on soil moisture dynamics will be critical for predicting changes in ecosystem level processes.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy. Gas produces approximately half the amount of CO 2 per unit of primary energy compared with coal. Here we consider a scenario where a fraction of coal usage is replaced by natural gas (i.e., methane, CH 4 ) over a given time period, and where a percentage of the gas production is assumed to leak into the atmosphere. The additional CH 4 from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO 2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. We also consider the effects of: methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO 2 emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0{\%}, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10{\%}. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small.},

Most antibiotics were produced by screening soil microorganisms, but this limited resource of cultivable bacteria was overmined by the 1960s. Synthetic approaches to produce antibiotics have been unable to replace this platform. Uncultured bacteria make up approximately 99{\%} of all species in external environments, and are an untapped source of new antibiotics. Wedeveloped several methods to grow uncultured organisms by cultivation in situ or by using specific growth factors. Here we report a new antibiotic that we term teixobactin, discovered in a screen of uncultured bacteria. Teixobactin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to a highly conserved motif of lipid II (precursor of peptidoglycan) and lipid III (precursor of cell wall teichoic acid). We did not obtain any mutants of Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to teixobactin. The properties of this compound suggest a path towards developing antibiotics that are likely to avoid development of resistance.},

abstract = {Methane-utilizing bacteria (methanotrophs) are a diverse group of gram-negative bacteria that are related to other members of the Proteobacteria. These bacteria are classified into three groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other physiological and morphological features. The type I and type X methanotrophs are found within the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria and employ the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II methanotrophs, which employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, form a coherent cluster within the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous. The growth of type II bacteria appears to be favored in environments that contain relatively high levels of methane, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and limiting concentrations of combined nitrogen and/or copper. Type I methanotrophs appear to be dominant in environments in which methane is limiting and combined nitrogen and copper levels are relatively high. These bacteria serve as biofilters for the oxidation of methane produced in anaerobic environments, and when oxygen is present in soils, atmospheric methane is oxidized. Their activities in nature are greatly influenced by agricultural practices and other human activities. Recent evidence indicates that naturally occurring, uncultured methanotrophs represent new genera. Methanotrophs that are capable of oxidizing methane at atmospheric levels exhibit methane oxidation kinetics different from those of methanotrophs available in pure cultures. A limited number of methanotrophs have the genetic capacity to synthesize a soluble methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the rapid oxidation of environmental pollutants including trichloroethylene},

Eighteen source categories were estimated using multiple data sets, including new empirical measurements at regional O{\&}G sites and a national study of gathering and processing facilities. Spatially referenced activity data were compiled from federal and state databases and combined with O{\&}G facility emission factors calculated using Monte Carlo simulations that account for high emission sites representing the very upper portion, or fat-tail, in the observed emissions distributions. Total methane emissions in the 25-county Barnett Shale region in October 2013 were estimated to be 72,300 (63,400-82,400) kg CH4 h(-1). O{\&}G emissions were estimated to be 46,200 (40,000-54,100) kg CH4 h(-1) with 19{\%} of emissions from fat-tail sites representing less than 2{\%} of sites. Our estimate of O{\&}G emissions in the Barnett Shale region was higher than alternative inventories based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Inventory, EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research by factors of 1.5, 2.7, and 4.3, respectively. Gathering compressor stations, which accounted for 40{\%} of O{\&}G emissions in our inventory, had the largest difference from emission estimates based on EPA data sources. Our inventory's higher O{\&}G emission estimate was due primarily to its more comprehensive activity factors and inclusion of emissions from fat-tail sites.},

abstract = {Uptake by soils is a relatively small flux in the global budget of atmospheric methane, but CH4 consumption rates in soils could be susceptible to changes in land use and climate. Global estimates of the soil sink for atmospheric CH4 are usually made by multiplying averages of small chamber measurements for various ecosystem types (or other strata) by estimates of the area covered by each stratum. Process-level models driven by gridded databases can also be used to make global flux estimates, to evaluate potential effects of changes in climate and land use, and to identify weaknesses in both data and mechanistic understanding. Methane uptake by soils is an appropriate process to model globally because the probable controls are simple relative to many other microbially mediated soil processes of trace gas production and consumption. Field experience suggests that diffusion of atmospheric CH4 into the soil is the primary factor limiting rates of CH4 oxidation in many soils. We have applied a modified version of Fick's first law based on theoretical computations for diffusivity in aggregated media, together with a soil water balance model run on a 1° global grid, to make independent estimates of CH4 uptake by soils worldwide. Uptake rates were assumed to be zero in very dry desert soils that are mostly devoid of microbial activity, in frozen soils, and in wetlands that are usually CH4 sources. Our mechanistically-based model supports a reference case for global net consumption of CH4 in soils of 17-23 Tg yr-1, which is near the middle of previously reported ranges, and is close to our own mean estimate from extrapolation of flux means across ecosystem strata (21 Tg CH4 yr-1). A new inference of our modeling approach is that over 40{\%} of the soil sink for CH4 occurs in warm and relatively dry ecosystems, such as semi-arid steppe, tropical savanna, tropical seasonal forest, and chaparral. This model prediction results from a favorable climate regime, high porosity in coarse-to-medium textured soils, and low moisture content that permits rapid gaseous diffusion in these semi-arid and seasonally dry tropical ecosystems. Very few data on CH4 fluxes exist from these areas that can be used to compare with model predictions. Because of this paucity of data where uptake rates may be relatively high, and because humans have altered these landscapes extensively, our results suggest that more study is needed in seasonally dry ecosystems in order to understand the impacts of land-use change on soil sinks for methane.},

The population of measured well pads is split into well pads with detectable emissions (N = 115) and those with emissions below the detection limit of the MFP instrument (N = 67). For those well pads with nonzero emissions, the distribution was highly skewed, with a geometric mean of 0.63 kg/h, a geometric standard deviation of 4.2, and an arithmetic mean of 1.72 kg/h. Including the population of nonemitting well pads, we find that the arithmetic mean of the well pads sampled in this study is 1.1 kg/h. This distribution implies that 50{\%} of the emissions is due to the 6.6{\%} highest emitting well pads, and 80{\%} of the emissions is from the 22{\%} highest emitting well pads.},

abstract = {Forest soil respiration is the sum of heterotrophic (microbes, soil fauna) and auto- trophic (root) respiration. The contribution of each group needs to be understood to evaluate implications of environmental change on soil carbon cycling and sequestration. Three primary methods have been used to distinguish hetero- versus autotrophic soil respiration including: integration of components contributing to in situ forest soil CO2 efflux (i.e., litter, roots, soil), comparison of soils with and without root exclusion, and application of stable or radioactive isotope methods. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, but isotope based methods provide quantitative answers with the least amount of disturbance to the soil and roots. Pub- lished data from all methods indicate that root/rhizosphere respiration can account for as little as 10 percent to greater than 90 percent of total in situ soil respiration depending on vegetation type and season of the year. Studies which have integrated percent root contribution to total soil respiration throughout an entire year or growing season showmean values of 45.8 and 60.4 percent for forest and nonforest vegetation, respectively. Such average annual values must be extrapolated with caution, however, because the root contribution to total soil respiration is commonly higher during the growing season and lower during the dormant periods of the year.},

abstract = {Difluoromethane (HFC-32; DFM) is compared to acetylene and methyl fluoride as an inhibitor of methanotrophy in cultures and soils. DFM was found to be a reversible inhibitor of CH4 oxidation by Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Consumption of CH4 in soil was blocked by additions of low levels of DFM (0.03 kPa), and this inhibition was reversed by DFM removal. Although a small quantity of DFM was consumed during these incubations, its remaining concentration was sufficiently elevated to sustain inhibition. Methanogenesis in anaerobic soil slurries, including acetoclastic methanogenesis, was unaffected by levels of DFM which inhibit methanotrophy. Low levels of DFM (0.03 kPa) also inhibited nitrification and N2O production by soils. DFM is proposed as an improved inhibitor of CH4 oxidation over acetylene and/or methyl fluoride on the basis of its reversibility, its efficacy at low concentrations, its lack of inhibition of methanogenesis, and its low cost.},

abstract = {Stable-isotope probing (SIP) is a culture-independent technique that enables the isolation of DNA from micro-organisms that are actively involved in a specific metabolic process. In this study, SIP was used to characterize the active methylotroph populations in forest soil (pH 3.5) microcosms that were exposed to (13)CH(3)OH or (13)CH(4). Distinct (13)C-labelled DNA ((13)C-DNA) fractions were resolved from total community DNA by CsCl density-gradient centrifugation. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences amplified from the (13)C-DNA revealed that bacteria related to the genera Methylocella, Methylocapsa, Methylocystis and Rhodoblastus had assimilated the (13)C-labelled substrates, which suggested that moderately acidophilic methylotroph populations were active in the microcosms. Enrichments targeted towards the active proteobacterial CH(3)OH utilizers were successful, although none of these bacteria were isolated into pure culture. A parallel analysis of genes encoding the key enzymes methanol dehydrogenase and particulate methane monooxygenase reflected the 16S rDNA analysis, but unexpectedly revealed sequences related to the ammonia monooxygenase of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) from the beta-subclass of the PROTEOBACTERIA: Analysis of AOB-selective 16S rDNA amplification products identified Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira sequences in the (13)C-DNA fractions, suggesting certain AOB assimilated a significant proportion of (13)CO(2), possibly through a close physical and/or nutritional association with the active methylotrophs. Other sequences retrieved from the (13)C-DNA were related to the 16S rDNA sequences of members of the Acidobacterium division, the beta-Proteobacteria and the order Cytophagales, which implicated these bacteria in the assimilation of reduced one-carbon compounds or in the assimilation of the by-products of methylotrophic carbon metabolism. Results from the (13)CH(3)OH and (13)CH(4) SIP experiments thus provide a rational basis for further investigations into the ecology of methylotroph populations in situ.},

abstract = {The migration mechanisms of endogenous gases in the geosphere are defined in relation to the fluid-rock conditions and analyzed by basic transport equations. Upon examining the geological factors that influence the physical parameters in the equations in porous and fracture media, and considering the widespread high-permeability of deep subsurface rocks, in terms of fracture aperture, (orders of 10-2 to 101 mm at depths of thousands meters, as suggested by recent crustal surveys) advection of carrier gases, in its several forms (gas-phase flow, water displacement by gas, gas slugs and bubbles) seems to represent a major migration process. Accordingly, in contrast with early views, the role of gas diffusion and water advection in the transport of endogenous gas to the Earth surface should be strongly minimized in many contexts. In a wide range of geological settings, carrier gases (CO2, CH4) may assume a dominant role in controlling transport and redistribution toward the Earth's surface of trace gases (Rn, He). Bubble movement in fissured rocks seems to be an effective way of rapid (gas velocities in the order of 100 to 103 m per day) and long-distance gas migration. The evolution from bubble regimes to continuous phase flow and vice versa, as gas pressure and fracture width change, is the most suitable mechanism towards determining the surface geochemical processes of seismo-tectonic, environmental and geo-exploration relevance. The transport effectiveness of trace gases by a carrier gas has yet to be studied in quantitative terms. It is already clear, however, that further studies on the distribution and behavior of trace gases approaching the Earth's surface may not be meaningful unless accompanied by carrier gas dynamics analyses. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Natural CO2 systems provide useful analogues for the longer-term processes which might take place in anthropogenic geological storage of CO 2. They are capable of providing information on the extent of dissolution of CO2 in formation brines, the nature of the fluid-mineral reactions, the kinetics of the fluid-mineral reactions, the behavior of sealing cap rocks exposed to CO2 or CO 2-charged brines and the consequences of escape of CO2 or CO2-charged brines up fault zones. However the natural analogues need to be properly sampled to recover this information. Surface sampling of fluids from active systems and rocks from exhumed systems allows inference of the nature and rates of critical processes but quantification of these processes from such data requires a significant number of assumptions such as the extent of CO2 degassing from fluids sampled at surface and the nature of paleofluids responsible for alteration of exhumed CO2 reservoirs. Work on such systems also highlights the need for better data and estimates of uncertainties on the data needed to describe equilibrium thermodynamics of minerals and fluids and the large uncertainties in the correct description of mineral reaction kinetics. Indeed the data recovered from natural CO2 systems significantly adds to the body of data recovered from natural systems on mineral-fluid reaction rates close to equilibrium where rates are too slow to be measured in laboratory experiments but which characterize most processes in near-surface geological environments. The important findings from the analogue studies to date include 1) a large fraction of CO2 in natural reservoirs has dissolved in formation brines, 2) the extent of fluid-mineral reactions in reservoirs is strongly dependent on reservoir mineralogy, 3) dissolution of iron minerals and precipitation of iron-bearing carbonates is an important process in reservoirs in continental red sandstones and permanently stabilizes CO2 in solid phases and also fixes potential metal contaminants, 4) the geological reservoirs are rock-dominated and the fluidmineral reactions will take place in the close-to-equilibrium region. Modeling the reaction kinetics therefore requires that the dependence of reaction rate with degree of disequilibrium needs to be much better understood, and 5) where CO2 does escape up fault systems through stacked permeable horizons a large fraction of the escaping CO2 is likely to be trapped by dissolution rather than escape to surface. The behavior of caprocks subject to long-term exposure to supercritical CO2 or CO2- charged fluids is a critical factor in calculating the risks of long-term CO2 storage. Despite the exploitation of natural CO 2 reservoirs, which have stored CO2 for hundreds of thousands to millions of years, we know of no good core sections from their caprocks. The few cores through caprocks are either from CO2-bearing hydrocarbon gas reservoirs and the shallow CO2-charged fluids from Green River. Full exploitation of the valuable data on the long-term behavior of CO2 in geological storage will therefore require that there is significant investment in sampling and studying the natural analogues. This will require the drilling of holes dedicated to recovering core and fluids from the natural reservoirs. Coring and sampling of supercritical CO2 and associated reservoir brines faces special challenges in drilling into over-pressured formations but this work will cost a small fraction of the ultimate investment in geological carbon storage. It will provide critical information on the long-term storage of carbon dioxide and technical expertise in sampling supercritical CO2 reservoirs.

abstract = {Methane emissions from soils are the net result of two processes: methane (CH4) production and CH4 oxidation. In order to understand how both processes respond to environmental changes, it is necessary to distinguish between CH4 production and oxidation. In bacterial cultures and small soil samples, difluoromethane (CH2F2) was found to inhibit CH4 oxidation reversibly, without affecting CH4 production. Hence, CH2F2 allows the study of CH4 production directly and of CH4 oxidation indirectly. To our knowledge, however, the inhibitory effect of CH2F2 within soil columns has not yet been evaluated. We therefore tested which CH2F2 concentration is needed for complete inhibition of CH4 oxidation in reconstructed 28 cm high peat soil columns under different water levels (WL). We found that soil columns require considerably higher headspace CH2F2 concentrations for complete inhibition of CH4 oxidation than small soil samples. Inhibition remained complete until ca. 24 h after CH2F2 exposure. Then, the inhibitory effect diminished. The time needed for the inhibitory effect to disappear depended on WL; at a low WL of -15 cm, the inhibitory effect declined slowly and oxidation rates recovered by 90{\%} only after 12 days. At WL = -5 cm, CH4 oxidation recovered much faster (90{\%} recovery after ca. 3 days). Last, CH2F2 addition significantly decreased the N2O emissions, whereas CO2 emissions remained unaltered. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A quantitative model of recent laboratory experiments on carbon isotope fractionation by methane-oxidizing bacteria is proposed. The simulated experimental apparatus consists of a bacterial culture with a constant liquid volume, a gas headspace and a methane bubbling mechanism. The relative effects of bacterial growth and transport phenomena that do not depend on cell density are clarified. In all calculations, gas-liquid mass transfer is defined by unconstrained model parameters. Limited mass transfer from the culture into the headspace, rather than the incomplete dissolution of substrate-rich bubbles, seems to have caused an apparent decrease in the measured carbon isotope fractionation. The experimenters attributed this fractionation shift to a growing imbalance among kinetic rates as methane consumption by bacteria increases. Model predictions support this interpretation but also show that changes in carbon isotope fractionation in the course of the experiments cannot be unambiguously correlated with bacterial cell density unless gas-liquid mass transfer parameters are calibrated. Simulations of other laboratory experiments indicate that a reported change in carbon isotope fractionation could, in part at least, be the result of experimental conditions rather than the emergence of a different methane oxidation pathway postulated by the experimenters. A careful evaluation of mass transfer from the liquid culture into the gas headspace is warranted in this type of experiments since isotope fractionation factors are likely to be used in a wide variety of environmental contexts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {One of the proposals for large-scale sequestration of fossil fuel-derived CO2 is deep geologic disposal in depleted oil/ gas reservoirs or deep aquifers. Previously published scenarios for this inadequately proven technology have either ignored or dismissed the possibility of vertical migration of gases caused by overpressure. Overpressuring of a reservoir or aquifer will be necessary in order to have acceptable rates for dispersal of injected CO2. This research describes methodology and the results of measurement of microseepage of CO2 and CH4 at a large-scale CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operation at Rangely, Colorado, USA. Shallow and deep soil gas concentrations, and direct transport of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere were measured. The interpretation of the measurements was complemented by both stable and radiogenic isotopic measurements of C. The results have demonstrated an estimated microseepage to the atmosphere of approximately 400 metric tonnes of CH4/a from the 78 km2 area of the Rangely field. Preliminary estimates of deep-sourced CO2 losses are {\textless}3800 tonnes/a, based on stable isotope measurements of soil gases. Several holes up to 10 m deep were drilled on, and off the field for nested gas sampling of composition and stable C isotopic ratios for CO2 and CH4. Carbon-14 measurements on CO2 from these holes indicate that deep-sourced CO2 microseepage losses were approximately 170 tonnes/a. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Measurements of CH4 and CO2 concentrations in soil gas, and as exchange rates (fluxes) with the atmosphere were made over the Rangely oil field, Colorado, USA. The Rangely field has been operated as a large CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project since 1986, and may serve as a prototype for CO2 sequestration in depleted oil/gas fields. The first of this pair of papers reported on the details of the methodology and results of field measurements of these gases, including light alkanes. The interpretation was enhanced by the extensive use of 13C and some 14C measurements. The fluxes of both CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere were estimated. This research has demonstrated and quantified the methanotrophic oxidation of microseeping CH4 in the unsaturated zone. Strong spatial variations were found and studied further by nested soil gas sampling in holes up to 9 m deep. Areas of microseepage were found, as well as areas where atmospheric CH4 was the only source for methanotrophic oxidation. Computer modeling was used to determine rate constants for the oxidation process. Strong seasonal differences exist in the rates of CH4 oxidation because of the semiarid and severe climate of Rangely. Rate constants of {\textless} 1 to {\textgreater} 1000 day-1 were determined. During the summer, the highest rates were near the surface, but shifted downward to about 2 m depth in the winter. Methanotrophic oxidation of CH 4 in the unsaturated zone will be the most important component of amelioration of CH4 microseepage induced by overpressuring of the reservoir undergoing CO2 injection. These types of measurements and interpretation will be necessary in order to fully understand the environmental effects of CO2 sequestration in oil/gas fields. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Anaerobic methane oxidation is a globally important but poorly understood process. Four lines of evidence have recently improved our understanding of this process. First, studies of recent marine sediments indicate that a consortium of methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria are responsible for anaerobic methane oxidation; a mechanism of 'reverse methanogenesis' was proposed, based on the principle of interspecies hydrogen transfer. Second, studies of known methanogens under low hydrogen and high methane conditions were unable to induce methane oxidation, indicating that 'reverse methanogenesis' is not a widespread process in methanogens. Third, lipid biomarker studies detected isotopically depleted archaeal and bacterial biomarkers from marine methane vents, and indicate that Archaea are the primary consumers of methane. Finally, phylogenetic studies indicate that only specific groups of Archaea and SRB are involved in methane oxidation.

abstract = {Recent increases in the use of hydraulic fracturing (HF) to aid extraction of oil and gas from black shales have raised concerns regarding potential environmental effects associated with predictions of upward migration of HF fluid and brine. Some recent studies have suggested that such upward migration can be large and that timescales for migration can be as short as a few years. In this article, we discuss the physical constraints on upward fluid migration from black shales (e.g., the Marcellus, Bakken, and Eagle Ford) to shallow aquifers, taking into account the potential changes to the subsurface brought about by HF. Our review of the literature indicates that HF affects a very limited portion of the entire thickness of the overlying bedrock and therefore, is unable to create direct hydraulic communication between black shales and shallow aquifers via induced fractures. As a result, upward migration of HF fluid and brine is controlled by preexisting hydraulic gradients and bedrock permeability. We show that in cases where there is an upward gradient, permeability is low, upward flow rates are low, and mean travel times are long (often {\textgreater}10⁶ years). Consequently, the recently proposed rapid upward migration of brine and HF fluid, predicted to occur as a result of increased HF activity, does not appear to be physically plausible. Unrealistically high estimates of upward flow are the result of invalid assumptions about HF and the hydrogeology of sedimentary basins.},

abstract = {The development ofmost unconventional oil and gas resources relies upon subsurface injection of very large volumes of fluids, which can induce earthquakes by activating slip on a nearby fault. During the last 5 years, accelerated oilfield fluid injection has led to a sharp increase in the rate of earthquakes in some parts of North America. In the central United States, most induced seismicity is linked to deep disposal of coproduced wastewater from oil and gas extraction. In contrast, in western Canada most recent cases of induced seismicity are highly cor- related in time and space with hydraulic fracturing, during which fluids are injected under high pressure during well com- pletion to induce localized fracturing of rock. Furthermore, it appears that the maximum-observed magnitude of events as- sociated with hydraulic fracturing may exceed the predictions of an often-cited relationship between the volume of injected fluid and the maximum expected magnitude. These findings have far-reaching implications for assessment of induced- seismicity hazards.},

This volume addresses a range of questions that were articulated in May 2008 at the First Deep Carbon Cycle Workshop in Washington, DC. At that meeting 110 scientists from a dozen countries set forth the state of knowledge about Earth's carbon. They also debated the key opportunities and top objectives facing the community.

A striking characteristic of Carbon in Earth is the multidisciplinary scientific approach necessary to encompass this topic. The following chapters address such diverse aspects as the fundamental physics and chemistry of carbon at extreme conditions, the possible character of deep-Earth carbon-bearing minerals, the geodynamics of Earth's large-scale fluid fluxes, tectonic implications of diamond inclusions, geosynthesis of organic molecules and the origins of life, the changing carbon cycle through deep time, and the vast subsurface microbial biosphere (including the hidden deep viriosphere). Accordingly, the collective authorship of Carbon in Earth represents laboratory, field, and theoretical researchers from the full range of physical and biological sciences.

It covers sampling and analyses of gases emitted from volcanic vents and determination of soil CO2 fluxes. The chemical and isotopic compositions of volcanic and hydrothermal gases reflect processes related to volatile sources and transport from the magma to the surface. Thermodynamics of gas equilibration allows for the investigation of gas compositional changes as a result of temperature, pressure, and dominant buffer reactions. Noble gases in combination with major gas species, such as CO2 and N2 provide important information on the ultimate sources of volcanic emissions in terms of mantle, crust, and subducted materials. The excess sulfur issue, where significantly more sulfur is emitted than what can be dissolved in the erupted magma, demonstrates the significance of characterizing volcanoes both in terms of their volatiles as measured in melt inclusions as well as in the volcanic plumes.},

abstract = {The chemistry of Yellowstone fumarole gases shows the existence of two component waters, type MC, influenced by the addition of deep mantle fluid, and type CC, influenced by crustal interactions (CC). MC is high in 3He/ 4He (22Ra) and low in 4He/ 40Ar (???1), reflecting input of deep mantle components. The other water is characterized by 4He concentrations 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than air-saturated meteoric water (ASW). These high He concentrations originate through circulation in Pleistocene volcanic rocks, as well as outgassing of Tertiary and older (including Archean) basement, some of which could be particularly rich in uranium, a major 4He source. Consideration of CO 2-CH 4-CO-H 2O-H 2 gas equilibrium reactions indicates equilibration temperatures from 170??C to 310??C. The estimated temperatures highly correlate with noble-gas variations, suggesting that the two waters differ in temperature. Type CC is ???170??C whereas the MC is hotter, at 340??C. This result is similar to models proposed by previous studies of thermal water chemistry. However, instead of mixing the deep hot component simply with cold, meteoric waters we argue that addition of a 4He-rich component, equilibrated at temperatures around 170??C, is necessary to explain the range in fumarole gas chemistry. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The mineralogy of terrestrial planets evolves as a consequence of a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. In pre-stellar molecular clouds, widely dispersed microscopic dust particles contain approximately a dozen refractory minerals that represent the starting point of planetary mineral evolution. Gravitational clumping into a protoplanetary disk, star formation, and the resultant heating in the stellar nebula produce primary refractory constituents of chondritic meteorites, including chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions, with {\~{}}60 different mineral phases. Subsequent aqueous and thermal alteration of chondrites, asteroidal accretion and differentiation, and the consequent formation of achondrites results in a mineralogical repertoire limited to {\~{}}250 different minerals found in unweathered meteorite samples. Following planetary accretion and differentiation, the initial mineral evolution of Earth's crust depended on a sequence of geochemical and petrologic processes, including volcanism and degassing, fractional crystallization, crystal settling, assimilation reactions, regional and contact metamorphism, plate tectonics, and associated large-scale fluid-rock interactions. These processes produced the first continents with their associated granitoids and pegmatites, hydrothermal ore deposits, metamorphic terrains, evaporites, and zones of surface weathering, and resulted in an estimated 1500 different mineral species. According to some origin-of-life scenarios, a planet must progress through at least some of these stages of chemical processing as a prerequisite for life. Biological processes began to affect Earth's surface mineralogy by the Eoarchean Era ({\~{}}3.85-3.6 Ga), when large-scale surface mineral deposits, including banded iron formations, were precipitated under the influences of changing atmospheric and ocean chemistry. The Paleoproterozoic "Great Oxidation Event" ({\~{}}2.2 to 2.0 Ga), when atmospheric oxygen may have risen to {\textgreater}1{\%} of modern levels, and the Neoproterozoic increase in atmospheric oxygen, which followed several major glaciation events, ultimately gave rise to multicellular life and skeletal biomineralization and irreversibly transformed Earth's surface mineralogy. Biochemical processes may thus be responsible, directly or indirectly, for most of Earth's 4300 known mineral species. The stages of mineral evolution arise from three primary mechanisms: (1) the progressive separation and concentration of the elements from their original relatively uniform distribution in the pre-solar nebula; (2) an increase in range of intensive variables such as pressure, temperature, and the activities of H2O, CO2, and O2; and (3) the generation of far-from-equilibrium conditions by living systems. The sequential evolution of Earth's mineralogy from chondritic simplicity to Phanerozoic complexity introduces the dimension of geologic time to mineralogy and thus provides a dynamic alternate approach to framing, and to teaching, the mineral sciences.},

The C isotope composition of respiratory CO2 (delta(R)) from shoots and roots of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) growing in a range of conditions was analysed. In all instances plants were grown in controlled environments with CO2 of constant concentration and delta(13)C. Respiration of roots and shoots of individual plants was measured with an open CO2 exchange system interfaced with a mass spectrometer. Respiratory CO2 from shoots was always C-13-enriched relative to that of roots. Conversely, shoot biomass was always C-13-depleted relative to root biomass. The delta-difference between shoot and root respiratory CO2 was variable, and negatively correlated with the delta-difference between shoot and root biomass (r(2) = 0.52, P = 0.023), suggesting isotope effects during biosynthesis. C-13 discrimination in respiration (R) of shoots, roots and whole plants (e(Shoot), e(Root), e(Plant)) was assessed as e = (delta(Substrate) - delta(R))/(1 + delta(R)/1000), where root and shoot substrate is defined as imported C, and plant substrate is total photosynthate. Estimates were obtained from C isotope balances of shoots, roots and whole plants of sunflower and alfalfa using growth and respiration data collected at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. e(plant) and e(Shoot) differed significantly from zero. e(plant) ranged between -0.4 and -0.9{\%}, whereas e(Shoot) was much greater (-0.6 to -1.9{\%}). e(Root) was not significantly different from zero. The present results help to resolve the apparent conflict between leaf- and ecosystem-level C-13 discrimination in respiration.},

abstract = {Carbon isotope fractionation factors reported for aerobic bacterial oxidation of CH4 (??CH4-CO2) range from 1.003 to 1.039. In a series of experiments designed to monitor changes in the carbon isotopic fractionation of CH4 by Type I and Type II methanotrophic bacteria, we found that the magnitude of fractionation was largely due to the first oxidation step catalyzed by methane monooxygenase (MMO). The most important factor that modulates the (??CH4-CH3OH) is the fraction of the total CH4 oxidized per unit time, which strongly correlates to the cell density of the growth cultures under constant flow conditions. At cell densities of less than 0.1 g/L, fractionation factors greater than 1.03 were observed, whereas at cell densities greater than 0.5 g/L the fractionation factors decreased to as low as 1.002. At low cell densities, low concentrations of MMO limit the amount of CH4 oxidized, while at higher cell densities, the overall rates of CH4 oxidation increase sufficiently that diffusion of CH4 from the gaseous to dissolved state and into the cells is likely the rate-determining step. Thus, the residual CH4 is more fractionated at low cell densities, when only a small fraction of the total CH4 has been oxidized, than at high cell densities, when up to 40{\%} of the influent CH4 has been utilized. Therefore, since Rayleigh distillation behavior is not observed, ??13C values of the residual CH4 cannot be used to infer the amount oxidized in either laboratory or field-studies. The measured (??CH4-CH3OH) was the same for both Type I and Type II methanotrophs expressing particulate or soluble MMO. However, large differences in the ??13C values of biomass produced by the two types of methanotrophs were observed. Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (Type II) produced biomass with ??13C values about 15??? higher than the dissimilated CO2, whereas Methylomonas methanica (Type I) produced biomass with ??13C values only about 6??? higher that the CO2. These effects were independent of the magnitude of the initial carbon isotope fractionation caused by MMO and were relatively constant despite changing ratios of assimilatory to dissimilatory carbon transformation by the organisms. This suggests that the difference in biomass carbon isotopes is primarily due to differences in the fractionation effect at the formaldehyde branch point in the metabolic pathway, rather than assimilation of CO2 by Type II methanotrophs. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The San Juan basin is the most prolific coalbed gas basin in the world with 1992 production exceeding 440 Gcf* (12.4 billion m3), resources of approximately 50 Tcf (1.4 trillion m3), and proved reserves of over 6 Tcf (170 billion m3). Coalbed gas wells with the highest production (initial potential greater than 10 Mcf/day or 0.28 million m3/day occur in the overpressured, north-central part of the basin. Hydrologic analysis indicates that overpressure in the Fruitland Formation is artesian in origin and represents repressuring that developed during the middle Pliocene. Highly permeable, laterally continuous coal beds override abandoned shoreline Pictured Cliffs sandstones and extend to the elevated recharge area in the northern basin to form a dynamic, regionally interconnected aquifer system. Coal rank and basin hydrodynamics control the composition of Fruitland coalbed gases, which varies significantly across the basin. Chemically dry gases in the north-central part of the basin coincide with meteoric recharge and regional overpressure. The consistency of methane deltaC-13 values across the basin, the presence of isotopically heavy carbon dioxide in coalbed gases and bicarbonate in formation waters, and biodegraded n-alkane distributions of some coal extracts indicate that coalbed gases in the north-central basin are a mixture of thermogenic (25-50{\%}), secondary biogenic (15-30{\%}), and migrated thermogenic (12-60{\%}) gases. Migrated, conventionally and hydrodynamically trapped gases, in-situ generated secondary biogenic gases, and solution gases result in gas contents that plot on or above the coal sorption isotherm. Bacteria transported basinward in groundwater flowing from the elevated northern basin margins metabolized wet gas components, n-alkanes, and organic compounds in the coal and generated secondary biogenic methane and carbon dioxide subsequent to coalification, uplift, erosion, and cooling. These gases may be limited to basin margins, where shallow depths and structural deformation result in higher permeability, or may extend more than 35 mi (56 km) basinward from the recharge zone. The presence of appreciable secondary biogenic gas indicates an active dynamic flow system with overall permeability sufficient for high productivity. Basin hydrogeology, reservoir heterogeneity, location of permeability barriers (no-flow boundaries), and the timing of biogenic gas generation and trap development are critical for exploration and development of unconventional gas resources in organic-rich rocks.},

abstract = {Trace gas emission measurements are frequently based on static chamber methods, where the trace gas accumulation within an enclosed headspace is followed over time. This study addressed the statistical part of trace gas measurements by comparing the typical approach, linear regression analysis, with a new method proposed by A.R. Pedersen, which is based on a stochastic extension of the diffusion model described by G.L. Hutchinson and A.R. Mosier. The new method provides an estimate of the emission rate, the standard error, P values, confidence intervals, estimates of model parameters, and a set of methods for validation of the assumed model. It was applied to data of N2O emissions from a peat meadow with the groundwater level at 20- and 40-cm depths, respectively. Furthermore, the three models mentioned above were compared in a simulation study using parameter values representative for the observed data. The simulations demonstrated that the assumptions underlying linear regression were violated, that the standard t test for significance did not have the expected properties, and that R 2 was a poor diagnostic for detecting deviations from these assumptions. The Hutchinson and Mosier estimator was not as biased as the linear regression estimator, but the method often failed because a necessary condition was not satisfied by the data, a large standard error was indicated, and the method did not provide a test of significance for the estimated emission rate. The new method provided a good description of the data and useful diagnostics for testing it, and due to its ability to use more observations (longer time series), it had a negligible failure rate and bias.},

abstract = {Non-steady-state (NSS) chambers are widely used to measure trace gas emissions from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, traditional interpretations of time-dependent chamber concentrations often systematically underestimate predeployment exchange rates because they do not accurately represent the fundamental physics of diffusive soil gas transport that follows chamber deployment. To address this issue, we formally derived a time-dependent diffusion model applicable to NSS chamber observations and evaluated its performance using simulated chamber headspace CO2 concentration data generated by an independent, three-dimensional, numerical diffusion model. Using nonlinear regression to estimate the model parameters, we compared the performance of the non-steady-state diffusive flux estimator (NDFE) to that of the linear, quadratic, and steady-state diffusion models that are widely cited in the literature, determined its sensitivity to violation of the primary assumptions on which it is based, and addressed some of the practicalities of its application. In sharp contrast to the other models, NDFE proved an accurate and robust estimator of trace gas emissions across a wide range of soil, chamber design, and deployment scenarios.},

abstract = {Renewed interest in quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from soil has led to an increase in the application of chamber-based flux measurement techniques. Despite the apparent conceptual simplicity of chamber-based methods, nuances in chamber design, deployment, and data analyses can have marked effects on the quality of the flux data derived. In many cases, fluxes are calculated from chamber headspace vs. time series consisting of three or four data points. Several mathematical techniques have been used to calculate a soil gas flux from time course data. This paper explores the influences of sampling and analytical variability associated with trace gas concentration quantification on the flux estimated by linear and nonlinear models. We used Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the minimum detectable fluxes ($\alpha$ = 0.05) of linear regression (LR), the Hutchinson/Mosier (H/M) method, the quadratic method (Quad), the revised H/M (HMR) model, and restricted versions of the Quad and H/M methods over a range of analytical precisions and chamber deployment times (DT) for data sets consisting of three or four time points. We found that LR had the smallest detection limit thresholds and was the least sensitive to analytical precision and chamber deployment time. The HMR model had the highest detection limits and was most sensitive to analytical precision and chamber deployment time. Equations were developed that enable the calculation of flux detection limits of any gas species if analytical precision, chamber deployment time, and ambient concentration of the gas species are known.},

abstract = {Coal bed and shale gas can be of thermogenic, microbial or of mixed origin with the distinction made primarily on the basis of the molecular and stable isotope compositions of the gases and production waters. Methane, ethane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are the main constituents of coal bed and shale gases, with a general lack of C2+ hydrocarbon species in gases produced from shallow levels and more mature coals and shales. Evidence for the presence of microbial gas include ??13C-CH4 values less than -50???, covariation of the isotope compositions of gases and production water, carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionations consistent with microbial processes, and positive ??13C values of dissolved inorganic carbon in production waters. The CO2-reduction pathway is distinguished from acetate/methyl-type fermentation by somewhat lower ??13C-CH4 and higher ??D-CH4, but can also have overlapping values depending on the openness of the microbial system and the extent of substrate depletion. Crossplots of ??13C-CH4 versus ??13C-CO2 and ??D-CH4 versus ??13C-H2O may provide a better indication of the origin of the gases and the dominant metabolic pathway than the absolute carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions of methane. In the majority of cases, microbial coal bed and shale gases have carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionations close to those expected for CO2 reduction. Primary thermogenic gases have ??13C-CH4 values greater than -50???, and ??13C values that systematically increase from C1 to C4 and define a relatively straight line when plotted against reciprocal carbon number. Although coals and disseminated organic matter in shales represent a continuum as hydrocarbon source rocks, current data suggest a divergence between these two rock types at the high maturity end. In deep basin shale gas, reversals or rollovers in molecular and isotopic compositions are increasingly reported in what is effectively a closed shale system as opposed to the relative openness in coal measure environments. Detailed geochemical studies of coal bed and shale gas and related production waters are essential to determine not only gas origins but also the dominant methanogenic pathway in the case of microbial gases. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {A growing dependence on natural gas for energy may exacerbate emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Identifying fingerprints of these emissions is critical to our understanding of potential impacts. Here, we compare stable isotopic and alkane ratio tracers of natural gas, agricultural, and urban CH4 sources in the Barnett Shale hydraulic fracturing region near Fort Worth, Texas. Thermogenic and biogenic sources were compositionally distinct, and emissions from oil wells were enriched in alkanes and isotopically depleted relative to natural gas wells. Emissions from natural gas production varied in $\delta$13C and alkane ratio composition, with $\delta$D-CH4 representing the most consistent tracer of natural gas sources. We integrated our data into a bottom-up inventory of CH4 for the region, resulting in an inventory of ethane (C2H6) sources for comparison to top-down estimates of CH4 and C2H6 emissions. Methane emissions in the Barnett are a complex mixture of urban, agricultural, and fossil fuel sources, which makes source apportionment challenging. For example, spatial heterogeneity in gas composition and high C2H6/CH4 ratios in emissions from conventional oil production add uncertainty to top-down models of source apportionment. Future top-down studies may benefit from the addition of $\delta$D-CH4 to distinguish thermogenic and biogenic sources.},

abstract = {Anomalous concentrations of CO2 and, to a lesser extent, CH4 have been detected over many active geothermal systems. The production of these gases, and of N2O, can be affected by both geothermal and biological processes. In this investigation, soil gas and soil-gas fluxes were measured at the Cove Fort-Sulphurdale geothermal field in Utah, which produces steam from both liquid- and vapor-dominated portions of the resource. The objectives were to determine the sources of these gases, the factors controlling their production, and the potential application to surface exploration and reservoir evaluation. Flux measurements were made in both summer and winter to evaluate and to quantify variations in seasonal noise. Carbon dioxide in soil gas, and in fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere during the summer sampling were dominated by soil respiration processes. During the winter, a geothermal component was visible. Methane fluxes were small negative values during the summer months, reflecting methanotrophic oxidation of atmospheric CH4 and, possibly, geothermal CH4 in the soils. Nitrous oxide in soil gas and in soil-gas fluxes to the atmosphere also varied seasonally. Surprisingly high concentrations were observed at locations directly above the steam cap. We suggests that NH3 produced in the geothermal reservoir by the Haber reaction was seeping upward where it was biologically oxidized to NO3
-. This oxidation, and possible localized biological reduction of NO3
- to N2, produced moderate amounts of N2O, averaging three times typical background flux rates and ten times background over the central portion of the geothermal area. There were higher fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O over the steam cap and the surrounding area, relative to background values. The high flux may reflect seepage of gas along faults that intersect the more extensive liquid-dominated portion of the reservoir. Nitrous oxide measurements in soil gas and soil-gas fluxes to the atmosphere offer promise as an exploration and reservoir characterization tool. (C) 2000 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The stable isotope composition of nmol size gas samples can be determined accurately and precisely using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). We have developed a technique that exploits this capability in order to measure d13C and d18O values and, simultaneously, the concen- tration of CO2 in sub-mL volume soil air samples. A sampling strategy designed for monitoring CO2 profiles at particular locations of interest is also described. This combined field and laboratory technique provides several advantages over those previously reported: (1) the small sample size required allows soil air to be sampled at a high spatial resolution, (2) the field setup minimizes sampling times and does not require powered equipment, (3) the analytical method avoids the introduction of air (including O2) into the mass spectrometer thereby extending filament life, and (4) pCO2, d13C and d18Oare determined simultaneously. The reproducibility of measurements ofCO2 in synthetic tank air using this technique is: W0.08{\%} (d13C), W0.10{\%} (d18O), and W0.7{\%} (pCO2)at 5550ppm. The reproducibility for CO2 in soil air is estimated as: W0.06{\%}(d13C), W0.06{\%}(d18O), and W1.6{\%} (pCO2). Monitoring soil CO2 using this technique is applicable to studies concerning soil respiration and ecosystem gas exchange, the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 (e.g. free air carbon dioxide enrichment) on soil processes, soil water budgets including partitioning evaporation from transpiration, pedogenesis and weathering, diffuse solid-earth degassing, and the calibration of speleothem and pedogenic carbonate d13C values as paleoenvironmental proxies.},

Most is of recent biologic origin, t4C analyses show that no more than 20 percent is released by fossil sources. The various ecosystems producing CH 4 are discussed and the total annual production is estimated to lie between 5.5 x 10 t4 g/yr and 11 x 1014 g/yr. The corresponding turnover times for atmospheric CH 4 range from 4 to 7 yrs. The destruction of CH 4 takes place mainly in the troposphere, most probably through the reaction of CH 4 {\S} OH -{\~{}} CH 3 + HaO. About 10 percent of the CH 4 is destroyed in the stratosphere. The CH 4 cycle contributes on the order of 1 percent to the atmo- spheric carbon cycle. Key},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) is the most abundant organic compound in the Earth's atmosphere, where it acts as a greenhouse gas and thus has implications for global climate change. The current atmospheric CH4 budget, however, does not take into account geologically-sourced CH4 seepage. Geological sources of CH4 include natural macro- and micro-seeps, mud volcanoes, and other miscellaneous sources such as gas hydrates, magmatic volcanoes, geothermal regions, and mid-ocean ridges. Macro-seeps contribute ???25 Tg (teragrams) CH4/yr to the atmosphere, whereas, micro-seepage contributes perhaps 7 Tg CH4/yr. Mud volcanoes emit ???5 Tg CH4/yr, and miscellaneous sources emit ???8 Tg CH4/yr to the atmosphere. Thus, the total contribution to the atmosphere from geological sources is estimated to be 45 Tg CH4/yr, which is significant to the atmospheric organic carbon cycle and should be included in any global inventory of atmospheric CH4. We argue that the atmospheric CH4 global inventory of the Interplanetary Panel on Climate Change must be adjusted in order to incorporate geologically-sourced CH4 from naturally occurring seepage.},

Several methods for measuring soil-surface CO2 fluxes are available: (1) closed-dynamic-chamber systems, (3) closed-static-chamber systems, (3) open-chamber systems, and (4) eddy covariance systems. This paper presents a field comparison of six individual systems for measuring soil-surface CO2 fluxes with each of the four basic system types represented. A single system is used as a reference and compared to each of the other systems individually in black spruce (Picea mariana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests. Fluxes vary from 1 to 10 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Adjustment factors to bring all of the systems into agreement vary from 0.93 to 1.45 with an uncertainty of about 10-15{\%}.},

abstract = {Water vapor in a natural gas stream can result in line plugging due to hydrate formation, reduction of line capacity due to collection of free water in the line, and increased risk of damage to the pipeline due to the corrosive effects of water. Therefore, water vapor must be removed from natural gas to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion from condensed water. Gas dehydration is the process of removing water vapor from a gas stream to lower the temperature at which water will condense from the stream; this temperature is called the "dew point" of the gas. Molecular sieves are considered as one of the most important materials that are used as desiccant materials in industrial natural gas dehydration. This work shows a study of natural gas dehydration using 3A molecular sieve as a type of solid desiccant materials, the scope of this work was to build up a pilot scale unit for a natural gas dehydration as simulation of actual existing plant for Egyptian Western Desert Gas Company (WDGC). The effect of different operating conditions (water vapor concentration and gas flow rate) on dehydration of natural gas was studied. The experimental setup consists of cylinder filled with 3A molecular sieve to form a fixed bed, then pass through this bed natural gas with different water vapor concentration, The experimental setup is fitted with facilities to control bed pressure, flow rate, measure water vapor concentration and bed temperature, a gas heater was used to activate molecular sieve bed. Increasing water vapor concentration in inlet feed gas leads to a marked decrease in dehydration efficiency. As expected, a higher inlet flow rate of natural gas decrease dehydration efficiency. Increasing feed pressure leads to higher dehydration efficiency. ?? 2011 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new procedure (HMR) for soil-atmosphere trace-gas flux estimation with static chambers is presented. It classifies data series into three categories according to criteria based on the application of a particular non- linear model and provides statistical data analyses for all categories. The two main categories are non-linear and linear concentration data, for which data are analysed by, respectively, the non-linear model and linear regression. The third category is represented by concentration data within the range of experimental error, or noise, from sites with no significant flux. Data in this category may be analysed by linear regression or simply classified as no flux. The particular non-linear model has been selected among alternatives because its exponential curvature generally fits non-linear static chamber concentration data well, and because it can be proven, mathematically, to be robust against horizontal gas transport through the soil or leaks in the chamber. The application of the HMR procedure is demonstrated on 244 data series of nitrous oxide accumulation over time. On average, 47{\%} of these data were non-linear, with an average flux increase over linear regression of 52{\%}. The classification and analysis of data with a small signal-to-noise ratio requires special attention, and it is demonstrated how diagnostic graphical plots may be used to select the appropriate data analysis. The HMR procedure has been implemented as a free add-on package for the free software R and is available for download through CRAN (http://www.r-project.org).},

The comparison between CRDS and GC showed that average CO2 fluxes were significantly higher for CRDS in both the laboratory and field, but the same experimental treatments effects were detected for both techniques. Compared to CRDS, theGCtechnique was severely limited in detecting CH4 fluxes in both the laboratory and field. Thus, only 16{\%} of measured GC fluxes were detectable in the laboratory and none in the field whereas CRDS could detect 65{\%} and 97{\%} of the CH4 fluxes in the laboratory and field. In contrast, N2O fluxes measured with CRDS and GC were not different for both the laboratory and field. It was observed that a lower proportion ofN2Ofluxes could be detected with CRDS (73{\%}) than GC (92{\%}) in the laboratory and similar recovery (65{\%} and 68{\%}) for the field. Thus, the same treatment effects were observed for both CRDS and GC. Furthermore, the comparison between CRDS and GC showed that enclosure times as short as 600s for our field study site are suitable to estimate the same treatment effects, but not necessarily flux magnitude.Weconclude that CRDS and GC can provide the same level of information regarding treatment effects in both laboratory and field experiments forCO2 andN2O, but not forCH4 and it is possible to reduce enclosure time without comprising comparability between the two techniques.},

In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

The molecular analysis shows that almost all the samples are enriched in methane (up to 93.2{\%} Vol.), with the exception of four gas samples collected around Mt. Etna showing high mantle-derived CO2 content. Methane isotope signatures suggest that these are thermogenic gases or a mixture between thermogenic gases and microbial gases. Although samples from some mud volcanoes in Southern Sicily (Macalube di Aragona) show isotope signatures consistent with a mixing model between thermogenic and microbial, by combining the molecular compositions (C1/(C2 + C3))and the methane isotope ratios (d13C1), such a process seems to be excluded. Therefore, the occurrence of secondary post-genetic processes should be invoked. Two main hypotheses have been considered: the first hypothesis includes that the gas is produced by microbial activity and altered post-genetically by microbial oxidation of methane, while according to the second hypothesis thermogenic gas have modified their molecular ratios due to vertical migration.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis from 'noncompetitive' substrates such as trimethylamine (TMA) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) may be quantitatively important in global methane budgets. This is because choline, glycine betaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide and related compounds, the precursors of TMA, are produced abundantly and ubiquitously by prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, particularly those from marine environments. 'Noncompetitive' substrates may be a particularly important source for the methane which occurs in the surface mixed layer of the ocean at or above saturation levels. In this study, we measured isotopic fractionation factors for methane and polyisoprenoid lipids formed by methanogens utilizing trimethylamine as their principal carbon source. Methanosarcina barked showed isotope effects ($\epsilon$) of 50.2‰ for the conversion of TMA to methane and 20.2‰ for TMA-biomass. Moreover, phytanyl chains of M. barkeri polar lipids were depleted by as much as 18‰ compared to biomass as was the co-occurring hydrocarbon PME. For the Antarctic methanogen Methanococcoides burtonii we measured even greater $\epsilon$ values of 71‰ (TMA to CH4), 49.6‰ (TMA to biomass) and 79.9‰ (TMA to phytanyl ether). It should be stressed that these large fractionations represent the maximum or near maximum values possible when the substrate concentrations are non-limiting. The isotopic compositions of methane and methanogen lipid formed by these organisms in natural environments will depend on how completely the substrates are consumed and on how this carbon is partitioned between assimilation and dissimilation processes. The $\epsilon$ values for methylotrophic methane formation measured here are significantly higher than those reported for aceticlastic methanogenesis (approx 21‰) and in the same range as those reported for reduction of carbon dioxide (32 to 79‰). The highly 13C-depleted signature of polyisoprenoid moleties compared to biomass of cultured methanogens suggests that there is significant isotopic fractionation inherent in the lipid biosynthetic pathways of Archaea.},

To study the temperature dependence of isotope fractionation during biological methanogenesis, three representatives of the order Methanococcales were cultivated in the temperature range 35-85°C. In the stationary growth phase, the carbon isotope fractionation factor between CO2 and CH4 was found to range between 1.048 and 1.079, depending on the growth temperature and on the type of fermentor In contrast to published data derived from culture experiments, our results fall in the range of naturally occurring carbon isotope fractionations of coexisting CO2-CH4 pairs in marine sediments. Moreover, the fractionation closely approached the thermodynamic equilibrium between both gases, although thermal isotope exchange processes are unlikely to occur below 200°C. Our findings suggest that flow-through culture experiments are useful when studying biological methanogenesis and associated (carbon-) isotope fractionation as a means of deciphering complex methanogenic processes in sediments.},

The landfill gases are strictly of microbial origin, whereas the others are largely thermogenic in origin. Baseline geochemical data from gases generated in municipal landfills and those produced from gas wells and coals in western Pennsylvania help to identify sources of stray methane while investigating gas migration incidents. Landfill gases exhibit C1/(C2+C3) ratios {\textgreater}3.8X10 3 , delta 13 CO 2 values of -19.7 to + 17.4 per mil, delta DCH 4 values of -197 to -353 per mil, and delta 13 CH 4 values of -33.2 to -57.4 per mil. Most delta 13 CO 2 values are positive, whereas most methane, carbon, and hydrogen are isotopically light. Exceptions to these generalizations can be traced to isotope fractionation due to methane oxidation in soil environments. 14 C activity in the landfill methanes ranges from 125 to 145{\%} modern. Thermogenic methane in the subsurface rocks of the region have delta 13 C and delta D values of approximately -27 to -55 per mil and -150 to -303 per mil, respectively. Chemical and isotopic analyses, combined with a thorough site investigation, provide a comprehensive approach for differentiating microbial from thermogenic gases and thermogenic gases from different sources. We used such an approach to confirm the offsite migration of landfill methane from a municipal landfill and the migration of stray methane from an abandoned gas pool to the soils adjacent to a commercial office building in western Pennsylvania.},

As it entails no fuel price risk or constraints, it also improves security of supply. Solar power enhances energy diversity and hedges against price volatility of fossil fuels, thus stabilising costs of electricity generation in the long term. Solar PV entails no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during operation and does not emit other pollutants (such as oxides of sulphur and nitrogen); additionally, it consumes no or little water. As local air pollution and extensive use of fresh water for cooling of thermal power plants are becoming serious concerns in hot or dry regions, these benefits of solar PV become increasingly important.},

These technologies allow for the decoupling of energy supply and demand, in essence providing a valuable resource to system operators. There are many cases where energy storage deployment is competitive or near-competitive in today's energy system. However, regulatory and market conditions are frequently ill-equipped to compensate storage for the suite of services that it can provide. Furthermore, some technologies are still too expensive relative to other competing technologies (e.g. flexible generation and new transmission lines in electricity systems). One of the key goals of this new roadmap is to understand and communicate the value of energy storage to energy system stakeholders. This will include concepts that address the current status of deployment and predicted evolution in the context of current and future energy system needs by using a “systems perspective” rather than looking at storage technologies in isolation.},

abstract = {As the pace of drilling activity in the Marcellus Formation in the northern Appalachian Basin has increased, so has the number of alleged incidents of stray natural gas migration to shallow aquifer systems. For this study, more than 2300 gas and water samples were analyzed for molecular composition and stable isotope compositions of methane and ethane. The samples are from Neogene- to Middle Devonian-age strata in a five-county study area in northeastern Pennsylvania. Samples were collected from the vertical and lateral sections of 234 gas wells during mud gas logging (MGL) programs and 67 private groundwater-supply wells during baseline groundwater-quality testing programs.Evaluation of this geochemical database reveals that microbial, mixed microbial and thermogenic, and thermogenic gases of different thermal maturities occur in some shallow aquifer systems and throughout the stratigraphy above the Marcellus Formation. The gas occurrences predate Marcellus Formation drilling activity. Isotope data reveal that thermogenic gases are predominant in the regional Neogene and Upper Devonian rocks that comprise the potable aquifer system in the upper 305 m (1000 ft) (average $\delta$13C1 = −43.53‰; average $\delta$13C2 = −40.95‰; average $\delta$DC1 = −232.50‰) and typically are distinct from gases in the Middle Devonian Marcellus Formation (average $\delta$13C1 = −32.37‰; average $\delta$13C2 = −38.48‰; average $\delta$DC1 = −162.34‰ ). Additionally, isotope geochemistry at the site-specific level reveals a complex thermal and migration history with gas mixtures and partial isotope reversals ($\delta$13C1 {\textgreater} $\delta$13C2) in the units overlying the Marcellus Formation.Identifying a source for stray natural gas requires the synthesis of multiple data types at the site-specific level. Molecular and isotope geochemistry provide evidence of gas origin and secondary processes that may have affected the gases during migration. Such data provide focus for investigations where the potential sources for stray gas include multiple, naturally occurring, and anthropogenic gases.},

abstract = {An expanded data set for gases produced from the Antrim Shale, a Devonian black shale in the Michigan basin, United States, has allowed for a detailed examination of the related chemical and isotopic compositional changes in the solid-gas-liquid systems that discriminate between microbial and thermogenic gas origin. In the Antrim Shale, economic microbial gas deposits are located near the basin margins where the shale has a relatively low thermal maturity and fresh water infiltrates the permeable fracture network. The most compelling evidence for microbial generation is the correlation between deuterium in methane and coproduced water. Along the basin margins, there is also a systematic enrichment in 13C of ethane and propane with decreasing concentrations that suggests microbial oxidation of these thermogenic gas components. Microbial oxidation accounts not only for the shift in 13C values for ethane, but also, in part, for the geographic trend in gas composition as ethane and higher chain hydrocarbons are preferentially removed. This oxidation is likely an anaerobic process involving a syntrophic relationship between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria.  The results of this study are integrated into a predictive model for microbial gas exploration based on key geochemical indicators that are present in both gas and coproduced water. One unequivocal signature of microbial methanogenesis is the extremely positive carbon isotope values for both the dissolved inorganic carbon in the water and the coproduced CO2 gas. In contrast, the 13C value of methane is of limited use in these reservoirs as the values typically fall between the commonly accepted fields for thermogenic and microbial gas. In addition, the confounding isotopic and compositional overprint of microbial oxidation, increasing the 13CC1,C2,C3 values to typically thermogenic values, may obscure the distinction between methanogenic and thermogenic gas},

---Field and Laboratory Methods---
- Fluids from the subsurface are subjected to major temp, temp, press, and gas loss during field sampling
- Drawing samples requires protecting them from the ambient environment
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} For subsurface liquids, mercuric chloride is added to kill bacteria

---Geologic Storage of CO2---
- Depleted petroleum fields and saline aquifersare estimated to have the storage capacity to sequester 10E03 Gt CO2
- Critical Point = 31°C and 74 bar
- Economics and previous practice will indicate that the most likely implementation of CO2 sequesteration will be through EOR disposal
- As usuual, the environmental concerns stem from storage integrity and secondary phases that are mobilized by geochemical reactions

---CO2 trapping mechanisms---
- Four main trapping mechanisms:
1) Structural and statiagraphic trapping
2) Residual trapping of CO2 by capillary forces in the pores of reservoir rocks, away from the supercritical fluid
3) Solution trapping, CO2 dissolves in formation water creating bicarbonate and bicarbonate ion species
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} EOS for CO2 indicate the following:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} a) solubilitry increases with decreasing salinity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} b) solibility increases with a greater Ca:Na ratio (why?)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} c) solubility decreases with increasing temper such that T {\textless}= 150°C, but solubility increases as T becomes greater than 150°C
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This occirs because entropy becomes positive at higher temperatures
4) Mineral trapping, captures CO2 by precipiatating:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} a) calcite
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} b) magnesite
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} c) siderite (FeCO3)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} d) dawsonite (NaAlCO3[OH2])
- Mineral trapping would be the most permenant method for CO2 trapping but this is a far slower method
- Field tests report that upon injecting CO2 into the Frio sandstones, pH values(of what, the brine??) lowered ({\~{}}3.0) resulting in the dissolution of calcite and iron oxyhydroxides {\textgreater}{\textgreater} this means that the pH increases as result of "slower dissolution of feldspar minerals (oligiclase, near to end-member Albite) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} resulting in calcite (would bond with carbonate ions a result of any free Ca ions from the oligoclase) and dawsonite (dawsonite would bond with the free hydoxyls) to precipitate 
----CO2 injection into basalts and ultramafic rocks----

annote = {----Introduction----
- Statoil started this process in 1996
- 60{\%} of global emisssions come from point sources

----Where could CO2 be Sequestered?----
- CO2 needs to be seuqestered as a supercritical fluid
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} A supercritical fluid is when a substance exists past its critical point and exists as a gas and a liquid. In other words it can effuse through solids like a gas and dissolve material like a liquid
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} To capture CO2 from a power plant with a 50 year lifetime, 500 million cubic meters of CO2 would need to be sequstered
- Sedimentay basins are conducive for CO2 sequestration because they have a high pore volume and and high connectivity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These basins need to be at least 800 m deep, have a thick seal impermeable layer(s), and high porosity
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Sequestering CO2 at that depth because: 1) the density of CO2 increases and becomes great enough by way of its volume decreasing relative to STP conditions, and 2) Protect ground water resources from possible acidification

--Scientific Fundamentals of Geological Sequestration---
- Since CO2 is less dense than other fluids in saline aquifers and oil reservoirs, it rises to the base of the seal, thus having an extensive seal is very important - this seal should not be susceptible to weathering by CO2 (i.e. Shale)
- At conditions for CO2 sequestration, CO2 and H2O are immiscible
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Good point of discussion - at the surface, CO2 is soluable in water (miscible) but here they are inmiscible
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Nat Gas and CO2 are miscible, this would allow for less concern of structural failure??

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} CO2 and oil/gas are generally miscible but water is immiscible with oil and CO2/oil mixtures (solutions?)
- There are three consequences of injecting CO2 [Multiphase Flow]
1) Fraction of pore space for CO2 is limited by flow dynamics
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Bring up critical saturation - flow cannot occur until critical saturation is reached, multiple phases means multiple saturations whose curves work in opposite directions (i.e. S{\_}CO2 vs. S{\_}Water)
2) Post-injection, water is imbibed back into the pore space since CO2 is often imobilized due to the decrease in saturation (S{\_}CO2)
3) Seal Integreity (See sticky note at top of next page)
----Geochemical INterations among CO2, Brine, and Formation Rocks----
- During injection, CO2 dissolves the formation into brine and decreases the pH from neutral to lower pH
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This leads to the dissolution of primary phases and the precipitation of secondary minerals (POINT OF DISCUSSION: What would be likely secondary minerals?)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} From RT modelling: Dissolution of carbonates --{\textgreater} increase porosity --{\textgreater} dissolution of feldspar --{\textgreater} which later leads to the precipitation of carbonates and clays --{\textgreater} decreasing porosity and permeability
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} If the dissolution of the primay phase mobilized contaminants, this strategy could be a serios problem
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} For instance, the mobilization of benzene, toulene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) could occur (excercabted in petroleum producing reservoirs), we need to test waters for DOC and these volitile organic compounds
----Long-term Fate-----
- Structural Trapping: Have a good seal to preven upward migration
- Capillary Trapping: Decrease in CO2 saturation below the critical saturation point will prevent flow and therefore can imobilize CO2
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This strategy is vital to locations without a strong strutural seal
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Authors suggest that all CO2 will be immobilized this way
- Solubility Trapping: when thermodynamic conditions allow, CO2 solubilizes into water
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} CO2 solubility increases with depth but decreses with increasing temp and salinity
- Mineral Trapping},

- Aresenate affects oxidative phosphorylation
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This directly impacts the synthesis of ATP as arsenate inhibits the uptake of phosphate thus not allowing ADP to become ATP
- Arsenite enters the cell via aqua-glyceroporins and binds to thiol groups (-SH) thus inavtivationg protens and oter receptors and transcription facvtors
- Aresnite is more toxic, soluable and bioavailable than aresnate
- The 1990s showed us the first evidence that microorganisms can use aresenic to produce energy
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The $\epsilon$-proteobacterium Sulfurospirillum carried out anerobic respiration with aresenate as the terminal electron accrptor and ogranic material as the electron donor (methylated aresenic?)

---Aresenic Metabolisms in Bacteria and Archaea----

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} In the field, these strains are found all over from pollutted to unpolluted, to engineered and to natural sites
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Temperature preferences also vary (from 20°C to {\textgreater}50°C)

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 4) heterotrophic aresenite oxidizers (HAOs)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} To make these distininctions, one of the key factors is whether the organism uses aresenic to produce energy or only transforms it during the denitrification process
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Additionally, the distinction between heterotrophic and lithotrophic is important

annote = {----Introduction-----
- Even though aresenic is toxic to many organisms on Earth, some organisms have learned to tolerate high concentrations of As and even to use it as an energy source
- Gaining energy from aresenic is accomplished through its redox chemistry
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} As has four oxidation states:
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} -3
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 0
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} +3
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} +5
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The predominant forms of inorganix As are in the +5 state as H2AsO4(1-) and HAsO4(2-) and the +3 state as aresnite
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The electrons that are transfered as As(3+) is oxidized to As(5+) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Electrons end up on electron acceptors such as N or O
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} In anerobic environments As(5+) is reduced to As(3+), when coupled to the oxidation of organic material or inorganic electron donors energy us produced

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} For instance, sorption on to earth materials (i.e. minerals) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [5+] Aresenate (AsO4(3-)) sorbs on materials in the mineral phase
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [3+] Aresenite AsO3(3-) sorbs less strongly though factors such as [As] and pH can change that fact

----Microbial Interactions with Aresenic----
- Arsenate mimics phosphate and can thus enter cells through transporters intended for phosphate
{\textgreater} Inhibits oxidative phosphorylation
- Aresenite enters through aqua-glycerolproins and interferes with a broader range of cellular functions
- Prokaryotes can defend themselves from aresenic by methylating the As to produce acids such as trimethyl arsine (TMA) 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This is why someone poisoned with aresenic may smell like garlic

abstract = {The organic rich sediments of the Skagerrak contain high quantities of shallow gas of mostly biogenic origin that is transported to the sediment surface by diffusion. The sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ), where anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulfate reduction occur, functions as a methane barrier for this upward diffusing methane. To investigate the regulation of AOM and sulfate reduction rates (SRR) and the controls on the efficiency of methane consumption, pore water concentrations, and microbial rates of AOM, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were determined in three gravity cores collected along the slope of the Norwegian Trench in the Skagerrak. SRR occurred in two distinct peaks, at the sediment surface and the SMTZ, the latter often exceeding the peak AOM rates that occurred at the bottom of the SMTZ. Highest rates of both AOM and SRR were observed in a core from a pockmark, where advective methane transport occurred, generating high methane and sulfate fluxes. But even at this site with a shallow SMTZ, the entire flux of methane was oxidized below the sediment surface. AOM, SRR and methanogenesis seem to be closely associated and strongly regulated by sulfate concentrations, which were, in turn, regulated by the methane flux. Rate measurements of SRR, AOM and methanogenesis revealed a tight coupling of these processes. Bicarbonate-based methanogenesis occurred at moderate sulfate concentrations ({\textgreater}5 mM) above the AOM zone but seemed to be inhibited in the depth where AOM occurred. The unbalanced stoichiometry of AOM and SRR in the SMTZ was more pronounced in rate measurements than in methane and sulfate fluxes, and seemed more likely be related to enhanced SRR in this zone than an underestimation of methane fluxes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulfate reduction (SRR) has a very low standard free energy yield of $\Delta$G{\{}ring operator{\}} = -33 kJ mol-1, but the in situ energy yield strongly depends on the concentrations of substrates and products in the pore water of the sediment. In this work $\Delta$G for the AOM-SRR process was calculated from the pore water concentrations of methane, sulfate, sulfide, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in sediment cores from different sites of the European continental margin in order to determine the influence of thermodynamic regulation on the activity and distribution of microorganisms mediating AOM-SRR. In the zone of methane and sulfate coexistence, the methane-sulfate transition zone (SMTZ), the energy yield was rarely less than -20 kJ mol-1 and was mostly rather constant throughout this zone. The kinetic drive was highest at the lower part of the SMTZ, matching the occurrence of maximum AOM rates. The results show that the location of maximum AOM rates is determined by a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic drive, whereas the rate activity mainly depends on kinetic regulation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A steady-state reaction-transport model is applied to sediments retrieved by gravity core from two stations (S10 and S13) in the Skagerrak to determine the main kinetic and thermodynamic controls on anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). The model considers an extended biomass-implicit reaction network for organic carbon degradation, which includes extracellular hydrolysis of macromolecular organic matter, fermentation, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, AOM, acetogenesis and acetotrophy. Catabolic reaction rates are determined using a modified Monod rate expression that explicitly accounts for limitation by the in situ catabolic energy yields. The fraction of total sulfate reduction due to AOM in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) at each site is calculated. The model provides an explanation for the methane tailing phenomenon which is observed here and in other marine sediments, whereby methane diffuses up from the SMTZ to the top of the core without being consumed. The tailing is due to bioenergetic limitation of AOM in the sulfate reduction zone, because the methane concentration is too low to engender favorable thermodynamic drive. AOM is also bioenergetically inhibited below the SMTZ at both sites because of high hydrogen concentrations (???3-6 nM). The model results imply there is no straightforward relationship between pore water concentrations and the minimum catabolic energy needed to support life because of the highly coupled nature of the reaction network. Best model fits are obtained with a minimum energy for AOM of ???11 kJ mol-1, which is within the range reported in the literature for anaerobic processes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent developments in the quantitative modeling of methane dynamics and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine sediments are critically reviewed. The first part of the review begins with a comparison of alternative kinetic models for AOM. The roles of bioenergetic limitations, intermediate compounds and biomass growth are highlighted. Next, the key transport mechanisms in multi-phase sedimentary environments affecting AOM and methane fluxes are briefly treated, while attention is also given to additional controls on methane and sulfate turnover, including organic matter mineralization, sulfur cycling and methane phase transitions. In the second part of the review, the structure, forcing functions and parameterization of published models of AOM in sediments are analyzed. The six-orders-of-magnitude range in rate constants reported for the widely used bimolecular rate law for AOM emphasizes the limited transferability of this simple kinetic model and, hence, the need for more comprehensive descriptions of the AOM reaction system. The derivation and implementation of more complete reaction models, however, are limited by the availability of observational data. In this context, we attempt to rank the relative benefits of potential experimental measurements that should help to better constrain AOM models. The last part of the review presents a compilation of reported depth-integrated AOM rates ($\Sigma$AOM). These rates reveal the extreme variability of $\Sigma$AOM in marine sediments. The model results are further used to derive quantitative relationships between $\Sigma$AOM and the magnitude of externally impressed fluid flow, as well as between $\Sigma$AOM and the depth of the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). This review contributes to an improved understanding of the global significance of the AOM process, and helps identify outstanding questions and future directions in the modeling of methane cycling and AOM in marine sediments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The key issue is the relative solubility of the phases in the fluid phase. Concepts such as coupled dissolution-precipitation, and autocatalysis are important in understanding these processes. Some consequences of porosity generation for metamorphic fluid flow as well as subsequent crystal growth are also discussed.},

annote = {----Introduction----
- Fluid-Rock interaction (FRI) were treated thermodynamically, equilibrium was assumed between fluid and rock
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This treateed FRIs as static
- Helgeson introduced the idea of an irreversible reaction and treated FRIs as dynamically evolving systems of multiple components
- Halgeson used real-time kinetics instead of reaction progress (as independent variable)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Reaction pathway as an independent variable is helpful when considering closed systems but when transport is the driving force behind the system, as is the case in many Earth Science scenarios, real-time is far more helpfull 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} in the 1980s, Lichtner clarified this idea by taking a Lagrangian look at these reactions. His work conceptualized the FRIs with pure advection, which meant that he followed the reactions as a packet of fluid travled through the rock medium
- Multi-Cpmponent Reactive Transport models (MC-RTM) sprung into being in the early 1980s with work by Berner, Lichtner, Yeh and Tripathi, and Steefel and Lasaga
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} These were contiuum based models: models that treat media as whole or continous rather than a collection of aggregate pieces, thus spatio-temporal scale is important (i.e. you need to know the REV)

----Transport Processes----
-***The most important factors to understand w/ transport processes are 1) advection, 2) molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion 
- Batch System: time scale where the net reaction rates are effectively zero, equilibrium is achieved (????What exactly is this???)
- Open System: author provides a laboratory example of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR)
[Point 1 of First Paragraph]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} In this example, a fluid is continously injected inside a reactor. This fluid is either in disequlibrium with itself or with the solid inside the reactor. The product that flows through the reactor reaches a steady-state, often at some distance away from equlibrium
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} We can characterize this steady state behavior by the ratio of the fluid residence time (tau{\_}res) to the reaction time (tau{\_}react) [Equation 001]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} However, realistic examples are more complex than the CSTR example, fluids are not injected at the same rate and the conditions of the medium change with space and usually with time as well
---{\%}Advection{\%}---
- Defined: The translation of space of dissolved/suspended material at the rate of movement of the bulk fluid phase
- Mathematically, a purely advected substance through porous media has an advective flux (J{\_}adv) equal to the porosity (phi) * average linear velocity of the fluid (v), and the concentration of the species in question (C{\_}i) [Equation 002] 
- [Equations 003-006] are used to explain Darcian Flow, or how to calculate the linear velocity in [Equation 002]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} In sum, the velocity depends on the permeability, hydraulic head, fluid viscosity, and fluid density
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}***Darcian flow only works with continuous mediums as opposed to pore scale flow, where the variability is too great***
---{\%}Molecular Diffusion{\%}---
- Pure advection is rarely observed in FRIs, thus diffusion of the solutes is important to characterize
- Diffusion is often described with Fickean rules (however, the authors point out that these only apply with dilute and uncharged species)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Mathematically, the diffusive flux of the solute (J{\_}i) equaled to the negative of the diffusive coefficient multiplied by the change in concentration of the solute with respect to the change in location of the solute (Fick's 1st Law) [Equation 007]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} We normally need to include a factor for tortuosity (the effective path length) for FRIs
- The diffusion is further described by integrating the diffusive flux over the space of the medium, the flux at the incoming end and the outgoing end (Fick's 2nd Law), detailed in [Equations 008-009]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The quthors show to solve [Equation 009] numerically for space and time by intergeating numerically [Equation 010]. This is important becuase it is difficult to analtically solve every time step of [Equation 009], in other words one may enter data for space and time into [Equation 010] and end up with a nice chart to examine
---{\%}Electrochemical migration{\%}---
- When charged species are in play, we can take an approach similar to Fickean Diffusion, in this case, the electrochemical component of the system is expressed in [Equation 012], developed by Newman in 1991
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Mathemtiically, the electrochemical migratoin is equal to the negative of the species charge, the species mobility, Faraday's constant, the concentration of species, and the change in electrochemical potential (the ease of which one may add more of that species to that given location) with regards to space within the medium [Equation 012]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [Equations 014-016] describe how one may calulate current density (i), the measure of electric potential across a crossection (or at a point along the axis in 1-D), and the conductivity (kappa{\_}e)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Knowing the conductivity (which is easy to measure) allows the geoscientist to quantify the mobility of the species using [Equation 016]. This in turn allows the geoscientist to quantify the diffusion coefficient for the ion/species in solution using the Nerst-Einstein equation [Equation 017]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} From the Nerst-Einstein Equation, we can then calculate the electrical potential gradient [Equation 018], mentioned in [Equation 012]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} The authors also mention that it is useful to quantify the fraction of current that is caried by a particular species (transference number), this will now be placed into [Equation 012] as the complete equation for electrochemical migration [Equation 020]. Knowing the complete transference number will further inform the geoscientist on the mobility of the species in the system
- [Equation 021] explains what happens when current and advection are absent
- Consequences of electrochemical migration
*** Prevents the unrelastic build up of charge when different diffusivities are in play***
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Authors express that at low temperatures, for the dissolution of feldspar, omitting electrochemical migration is fine since concentration gradients do not appear. However at high temps, these gradients present themselves and identical diffusion coefficients do not work
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} This is evidenced in Figure 003, alkalinity is shown to vay linearly with the ions, when no distiction is made between the diffusion of the ions; however, when the distinction is made, alkalinity is shown to behave (??) (?How is the MC-Diffusion electrochemical model more linear in terms of pH?)
---{\%}Diffusion in concentrated solutions{\%}---
- Fickean diffusion is not very applicable when solutions are more highlu concetrated with ions, this is expressed in [Equation 022] by changing the diffusion coefficient (D) to the coefficients based on irreversible thermodynamics and the chemical potential
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} **Fluxes are lineraly related to gradients of chemical potentials instead of concentrations
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [Equations 023-026] relate how one may fully develop the electrochemical migration for concentrated solutions just as with [Equation 020]
---{\%}Tortuosity{\%}---
- [Equations 027-032] explain tortuosity (effective path length) in greater depth
- Skipped, not enough time to cover this detail
---{\%}Hydrodynamic dispersion{\%}---
- Hydrodynamic dispersion is expressed in as a linear relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficient (D{\_}h) and the concentration gradient, [Equation 033]
- (D{\_}h) is the sum of mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion, [Equation 034]
---{\%}Mechanical dispersion{\%}---
[Equations 035-37] describe Taylor-Arias Dispersion
- In general terms it is describes the modification of the advective front (diffusion along the principal direction of flow and diffusion perpendicular to that principal direction)
----{\%}Macrodispersion{\%}----
[COMPLETE SECTION]
-------{\%}{\%}Stocahsitic descriptions of dispersion{\%}{\%}-----
[COMPLETE SECTION]
----{\%}Reaction-induced changes in transport properties{\%}----
- So far, it has been assumed that the physical medium has been unperturbed as the fluid solution has flown though it
- However, one of the hardest problems to solve in RT is when the medium changes over time due to its interaction with the solution
- This "remedided" through experiementation as presented with th cited material in this section

---Reactive Transport Basics---
- The mathematical foundation guiding reactive transport is numerical simulation. Analytical solutions may be "exact" by definition but they often require unwarranted approximation, and they reduce the speed and breadth of computation
- In the openening of this section, the authors present the simple advection-dispersion-reaction (ARD) in one dimnsion for a consevative solute
-- Point 1: Conserve the mass of the solute 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [Equation 038] describes the flux of the solute from point x to point x+deltax, the first derivative of the flux with respect to x
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [Equation 039] presents [Equation 038] information in three dimensions and equates it to the totcal concentration of the solute that is present at any time (t)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} We can than build the basic (no electrochemical migration) equation for advection and dispersion to account for the concentration of the solute at any time (t) [Equation 40]
-- Point 02: A real example requires that the geoscientist consider the area of the reaction surface and the solubility of solid phase (e.g., SiO2[aq] reacting with quartz)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} [Equation 041] expresses the ARD but this time as an parabolic PDE and terms for the rate of the reaction (k), the area for the reaction to take place (A), and the ration of solute versus the solubility of the solute (C{\_}eq)
---{\%}Important non-dimensional parameters{\%}---
- The authors state that converting PDEs to a non-dimensional form, we can find the relative importance of parameters like chemical reactions, advetion, and dispersion have among each other in RT
- [Equations 042-045] describe how to convert space and tim into a non-dimensional parameters by using the characteristic length, time, reaction time scales. The geoscientist can also achieve the time scale for advective transport as well
- The combination of these non-dimensional parameters lead to the generation of Damkohler nymbers, for advective transport in relation to reaction time and diffusive transport in relation to reaction time [Equations 046-047]
- One of the most important non-dimensional parameters is the Peclet number, this ratio describes the importance of diffusive transport in relation to advective transport [Equation 048]
- Once you add the non-dimensional form of concentration [Equation 049] and the non-dimensional form for time [Equation 050], the geoscientist can proceed to rewrite [Equation 041] to account for these parameters [Equation 051]
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} In situations were the Peclet and Damkohler numbers are {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1, we observe that the reaction front is sharply defined, and equilibrium is achived over the characteristic length scale (see Figure 010, high Peclet = sharper reaction front)
---{\%}Transport versus surface reaction control{\%}---
- Local equilibrium can be attained under steady-state
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} At the point where equilibrium is achieved, the length scale becomes a transport-controlled process as opposd to the rate of attachement/detatchment of ions to the surface of the solid phase (this is usually cited in environmental studies)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Example: the dissolution of calcite is cited as a diffusion (transport) process as opposed to a surface-reaction process when pH is less than 4
- [Equation 052] was skipped due lack of interest and lack of time
---{\%}Rates of FRI in heterogenous systems{\%}---

----Case Studies----
-----{\%}Rates of Anerobic Methane Oxidation in Marine Sediments{\%}----
- Study took place in te Norwegian Trench off of the coast of Norway
- RTM framework is validated by two gravity core from the site that show anerobic oxdation of CH4 0.5 meters thick at 1 meter depth
- Table 3 highlights the pathways of organic degredation (reduction)
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} RXN 3 is similar to the reductive reactions I discyssed earlier in the semester [acetate reduction] these lead to RXNs 6-7 that produce methane},

abstract = {The reactions that occur at the mineral–water interface are central to all geochemical processes. They affect a wide range of important Earth processes, all of which involve geochemical element cycling. Examples include weathering and soil formation, nutrient availability, biomineralization, acid mine drainage, the fate of contaminants, nuclear waste disposal, and minor element incorporation and partitioning during mineral growth. Each of these processes, and its reaction rates, is ultimately controlled by reactions that occur at mineral surfaces. Through the development of advanced analytical methods, direct observations of mineral reactions at the nanoscale have enabled exciting new possibilities for clarifying the mechanisms governing mineral–fluid reactions.},

The interfacial mineral-fluid boundary layer is pretty interesting. I wonder, quantitatively, how different the thin-film is with respect to the fluid. Also, how could one go about describing the physical parameters of the thin film (e.g. chemical composition, width, velocity, activity, etc.). 
- This would have tremendous applications in materials designing especially in designing protective boundaries that are constantly exposed to reactive scenarios or environements.

??? I could use further clarification on the mechanisms behind the results that show subsequent precipitation of a new phase in the nonstocihiometric signature ???
ANSWER: The goal is to measure the conposition of the boundary or thin fluid. This makes the fractionation between incompatible and compatible lower than one would measure if they only measured the mineral and bulk solution
- The experiemental measurements of the concentration of a mineral (say Zircon) demsonstrate a lower partition value than with natural measurements. This is due to the fact we overestumate the partition coefficient for the experiemental sample near Lanthinum because it is compatible with Zircon thus decreasing the La in the bulk melt and increasing the estimate of the partition; the opposite is true for Leutium

We may observe that defected or damaged zircon will continue to dissolve zircon past saturation and precipitate out zircon creating new crystals},

abstract = {Isotopologues of molecular gases containing more than one rare isotope (multiply substituted isotopologues) can be analyzed with high precision (1$\sigma$ {\textless}0.1‰), despite their low natural abundances (∼ ppm to ppt in air), and can constrain geochemical budgets of natural systems. We derive a method for calculating abundances of all such species in a thermodynamically equilibrated population of isotopologues, and present results of these calculations for O2, CO, N2, NO, CO2, and N2O between 1000 and 193 to 77 K. In most cases, multiply substituted isotopologues are predicted to be enriched relative to stochastic (random) distributions by ca. 1 to 2‰ at earth-surface temperatures. This deviation, defined as $\Delta$i for isotopologue i, generally increases linearly with 1/T at temperatures ≤ 500 K. An exception is N2O, which shows complex temperature dependences and 10's of per-mill enrichments or depletions of abundances for some isotopologues. These calculations provide a basis for discriminating between fractionations controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics and other sorts of isotopic fractionations in the budgets of atmospheric gases. Moreover, because abundances of multiply substituted isotopologues in thermodynamically equilibrated populations of molecules vary systematically with temperature, they can be used as geothermometers. Such thermometers are unusual in that they involve homogeneous rather than heterogeneous equilibria (e.g., isotopic distribution in gaseous CO2 alone, rather than difference in isotopic composition between CO2 and coexisting water). Also, multiple independent thermometers exist for all molecules having more than one multiply substituted isotopologue (e.g., thermometers based on abundances of 18O13C16O and 18O12C18O are independent); thus, temperatures estimated by this method can be tested for internal consistency.

annote = {Solid solutions sequestering phases sounds similar to the process of hydrating brucite to sequester CO2 in the subsurface (mentionid in the intro article)

Coprecipitation (CPT) is the processes where a solute that would normally remain dissolved in solution but instead binds to solid material by: 
1) Inclusion: subsitutes for another atom in the lattice structure
2) Adsorpbtion: binds to the structure
3) Occlusion: gets trapped within the lattice structure

Copreciptation is taken account with greater empahsis with high-temperature geochemistry, and adsorption is discounted. With low-temperature geochemistry, the opposite is true, adsoprtion is studied in greater detail than coprecipitation 

Surface passivation (aka surface posisoning)

-----Ions and Molecules form Crystals------
Two theories for the crration of crystals
1) Classical: Dervived from thermodynamic - successive aggreation
2) Non-Classical: Observation based, agggregation of nano-sized clusters that organize into larger crystal in organized manners or stochastically

Historically Ideas for Crystalization

Critical Radius - once atams have aggregated with a radius of a specific width (now no longer reversible), there will be growth of the crystal but until then the atoms will redisolve into the solution

The degree of supersaturation influences the critical radius.  The greater the supersaturation, the smaller the critical radius

1st: Nucleation - random collisions of the monomers that aggregate until the monomers reach the critical radius
2nd: Growth - Block by block growth creation

[BCF model: Widely used model for growth of crystals]

Spiral Growth model: layer by layer model that establishes the basics of the classic 
- 
- the subsuquent advancement aided by the kinks and edges of the crustal

Non-classical crystalization: alternative crystal processes 
- nanomers participating in the building process

Growing extremely large crystals occurs in solutions rather than melts/magmas because the advection-diffusion is favored and faster for the transport of ions to build large crystals},

abstract = {Sampling is the most important part in a geochemical survey for mineral exploration or environmental purposes. Planning an effective sampling campaign to meet survey objectives should be based on a phased or stepwise use of applied geochemical methods, starting from the desk study that collects and evaluates all available data and information. This is followed by the field investigation, which should begin with the orientation survey, where a variety of sampling, sample preparation, and analytical methods are tested with the objective of finding the most cost-effective methodology to be applied in the succeeding steps of the follow-up and detailed investigations. Apart from sampling, another significant part of a survey is sample preparation. Mistakes in sampling and sample preparation are difficult to trace, and affect the final results and success of a survey. Hence, these are the two parts of a geochemical survey that should be performed with the utmost care. Sampling procedures of stream sediment, overbank or floodplain sediment, stream water, ground water, rock, residual soil, urban soil, house dust, attic dust, and road dust are described, as well as sampling in the laboratory. The importance of randomization of samples and quality control procedures are also discussed.

abstract = {During the process of exploring aqueous piperazine chemistry under simulated flue-gas scrubbing conditions, positive-ion electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) analyses of the resulting reaction mixtures in a triple quadrupole system revealed the presence of peaks at m/z 116 and 145, the putative N-nitroso derivatives of piperazine. Confirmation of the presence of these species in the reaction mixtures was achieved using collision-induced dissociation experiments. A purchased standard, together with in-house synthesised N-nitrosopiperazine standards (including N-nitroso derivatives derived from deuterium-labelled precursor materials), were used for this purpose. Across a small range of collision energies, large fluctuations in the abundance of the two major product ions of protonated N-nitrosopiperazine, m/z 86 and 85, were observed. Using B3LYP/6-311 + +G(d,p) computations, the potential energy surface was determined for loss of NO and [H,N,O]. At an activation energy slightly in excess of 1 eV, intramolecular isomerisation precedes loss of NO (m/z 86) via a 4,1 H-shift, and at activation energies between 2.1-2.3 eV, consecutive loss of NO and atomic hydrogen competes with the direct loss of nitrosyl hydride (m/z 85). It is recommended that any multiple reaction monitoring method for quantifying N-nitrosopiperazines at low collision energies use the sum of both transitions (m/z 116 ← 85, m/z 116 ← 86) to avoid errors that could be introduced by subtle changes in ES source conditions or collision voltages. This approach is adopted in an HPLC/MS/MS method used to monitor the degradation of N-nitrosopiperazine exposed to (i) broad-band UV light and (ii) heat typical of an amine regeneration (stripper) tower. The results reveal that aqueous N-nitrosopiperazine is thermally stable at 150°C but will degrade slowly upon exposure to UV light.},

Although isotopic compositions of methane have traditionally aided source identification, the abundance of its multiply substituted “clumped” isotopologues (for example, 13CH3D) has recently emerged as a proxy for determiningmethane-formation temperatures. However, the effect of biological processes on methane's clumped isotopologue signature is poorly constrained.We show that methanogenesis proceeding at relatively high rates in cattle, surface environments, and laboratory cultures exerts kinetic control on 13CH3D abundances and results in anomalously elevated formation-temperature estimates.We demonstrate quantitatively that H2 availability accounts for this effect. Clumped methane thermometry can therefore provide constraints on the generation of methane in diverse settings, including continental serpentinization sites and ancient, deep groundwaters.},

We use a simple model to simulate isotopic transport of CO2 from soil into a headspace chamber, followed by laboratory validation of predicted values. The combined effects of isotopic and concentration gradients results in an observed fractionation of different magnitude than the accepted theoretical diffusion fractionation, which falls continuously during the headspace equilibration period. We show that isotopic data from a non-steady state diffusive environment can be misinterpreted when steady state diffusion models are applied. The simple processes illustrated here can be extended to any isotopic species, and any diffusive environment where some (or full) equilibration takes place between component species.},

MC-ICP-MS
- This technique has helped the field by reducing the size of the sample by an order of magnitude (improvement from TIMS)
- Analytical precision has increasted from a factor of 5 to 10

-----Chemical fractionation and mobilzation factors-----
Thermodynamics of radionuclides in solution
- The Uranium-238 decays seires is governed by classical thermodynamic parameters (T,P, and solution comp. (i.e. pH, redox potential, iocinc strength, etc.))
- U(IV) and U(VI) are the predomininat stable speices of U in enevnronmental conditions in aqueous systems
{\textgreater} U(IV) is insoluable in redicing condtions and precipitates as as uranitite
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Solubility of U(IV) increases in lower pH conditions (due to (U-F complexes) as well as pH conditoins above 8 where U4+ forms U(OH)5{\^{}}1- 
- In oxic conditions, U is in its most oxidized state U(VI) and forms UO2{\^{}}2+ which complexes with carbonate, hydroxides, phosphaes, and fluorides
- U(VI) is far more soluable than U(IV) this leads to the formation of the complexes (mentioned in the bullet above) which in turn leads t the solubility+mobility of U in the surface and ground waters
{\textgreater} Organic ligands can complex with U, which influences its transport (positive or negatuve influence (??)
- Thorium is found as Th(IV) in the environemnt and is not solubable or mobile at pH values greater than 4
{\textgreater} Complexes are are crucial in mobilizing the element (SO4{\^{}}2-, FPO4{\^{}}4-, OH{\^{}}1-)
- Both U and Th form strong organic complexes with humic and fulvic acids
- Apart from thermodynamics, the disequilbria of radionuclides is influenced by the adsorption of radionuclides on mineral surfaces as well as rxns with organic matter, mirobes, and colloids

Radionuclide interations with minerals
- The adsorption of radionuclides onto mineral surfaces can be the limiting factor in determining the mobility of radiocuclides in surface and ground-water 
{\textgreater} Temp., cationic exechange capacity, and specific area control the adsoportion of radionuclides onto mineral surfaces
{\textgreater} Sorbes easier with Fe-oxides and silica gels {\textgreater}{\textgreater} less easier with clays and micas 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} sorption is two orders of magnitude higher with illites than kaolinites

{\textgreater}{\textgreater} reduce U(VI) to U(IV) by organic matter (not sure what "by organic matter means," maybe it is referring to the ligands that help to mobilize the U to more reductive envnrionments) 
- The pH of the solution influences how much U can be retained by the mineral
{\textgreater}{\textgreater} Difficult to fix U when pH {\textless} 4 and pH {\textgreater} 9; max retention occurs at pH= 6 to 7
- The prescence of organic and inorganic ligands can effect sorption (e.g. carbonate inhibits U sorbing ont biotite and Fe-oxides
{\textgreater} Contrastingly, humuic acids enhance the sorption of U onto minerals in low pH environments 
- Unlike U, Th and Ra are reactive and absorbe easily to minerals
{\textgreater} E.g. Th can absorb to Fe-oxides even at pH values of 2

Impacts of organic matter, microbes, and colloids
- Through metabolism-indpendent and metabolism-dependent reactions, geoscientists have oberserved the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) and have attributed this to microbial activty (specifically, iron and sulfate reducers)

abstract = {Clumped isotope geochemistry is concerned with the state of ordering of rare isotopes in natural materials. That is, it examines the extent to which rare isotopes (D, 13C, 15N, 18O, etc.) bond with or near each other rather than with the sea of light isotopes in which they swim. Abundances of isotopic 'clumps' in natural materials are influenced by a wide variety of factors. In most cases, their concentrations approach (within ca. 1{\%}, relative) the amount expected for a random distribution of isotopes. Deviations from this stochastic distribution result from: enhanced thermodynamic stability of heavy-isotope 'clumps'; slower kinetics of reactions requiring the breakage of bonds between heavy isotopes; the mass dependence of diffusive and thermo-gravitational fractionations; mixing between components that differ from one another in bulk isotopic composition; biochemical and photochemical fractionations that may reflect combinations of these simpler physical mechanisms; and, in some cases, other processes we do not yet understand. Although clumped isotope geochemistry is a young field, several seemingly promising applications have already emerged. Most importantly, it appears that proportions of 13C-18O bonds in carbonate minerals are sensitive to their growth temperatures, independent of bulk isotopic composition. Thus, 'clumped isotope' analysis of ancient carbonates can be used as a quantitative paleothermometer that requires no assumptions about the ??18O of waters from which carbonates grew. This approach has been used to reconstruct marine temperatures across the Phanerozoic (reaching back to the Silurian), terrestrial ground temperatures across the Cenozoic, thermal histories of aqueously altered meteorites, among other applications. Clumped isotope geochemistry is also placing new constraints on the atmospheric budget and stratospheric photochemistry of CO2, and should be capable of placing analogous new constraints on the budgets of other atmospheric gases. Finally, this field could be extended to encompass sulfates, volatile hydrocarbons, organic moieties and other materials. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Interesting that that double substitution decreases vibrational energy more than twice the single-substitution
- This idea is rewriting the proof cited by Bieglson 1955

Enthalpy of Mixing: the heat taken absorbed or released when two conservative substances mix/interact. 
- This would be a release (endothermic) mixing, right?

Eiler states that thermodynamics will drive continuing subsutution of isotopologues or once a molecule has been singly substitude, it will move towards multiply subsitituted.

Important to note that the ▲ represents the deviationfrom stochasticity rather than a SRM (mass-independent [clumped] vs mass-depedent [traditional] fractionation)

-----Analytical approaches: real and imaginable ----
Requirements for analyzing clumped isotopes
1) higher abundance sesnsitivity
2) high precision (1E-05)
3) high sample purity
4) integrity of roginal bonds in the analyte (no reactions from extraction to measurement)

Why would 13C18O be a bad choice? Because it is so rare?

Analyte molecules can have their molecules redistrubuted during

----Isotope Fractionation----
The greater the oxidation state of Cl, the more enriched the composition of $\delta$37Cl
- The fractionation of Cl also depends on the atom(s) that Cl is bonded to. For instance if the cation bonded to Cl has a +2 oxidation state, fractionation will be greater than if the cation is at +1
- Silicates are roughly 2 to 3‰ enriched in $\delta$37Cl compared to brines
- Organic molecules will be 5.8 to 8.5‰ enriched in $\delta$37Cl
- Gaseous HCl will be enriched in $\delta$37Cl relative to the anion Cl-
---{\textgreater} However, with bio-mediated decopmosition of chlorinated alipahatic hydrocarbons, observed fractinoations are 1/2 of calcualted values
Heavy isotopes will tend to be concentrated in compounds that have greater bond strength (e.g. CH3Cl)

abstract = {Cycling of redox-sensitive elements such as Fe is affected by not only ambient EhpH conditions, but also by a signifi cant biomass that may derive energy through changes in redox state (e.g., Nealson 1983; Lovely et al. 1987; Myers and Nealson 1988; Ghiorse 1989). The evidence now seems overwhelming that biological processing of redox-sensitive metals is likely to be the rule in surface- and near-surface environments, rather than the exception. The Fe redox cycle of the Earth fundamentally begins with tectonic processes, where juvenile crust (high-temperature metamorphic and igneous rocks) that contains Fe which is largely in the divalent state is continuously exposed on the surface. If the surface is oxidizing, which is likely for the Earth over at least the last two billion years (e.g., Holland 1984), exposure of large quantities of Fe(II) at the surface represents a tremendous redox disequilibrium. Oxidation of Fe(II) early in Earths history may have occurred through increases in ambient O2 contents through photosynthesis (e.g., Cloud 1965, 1968), UVphoto oxidation (e.g., Braterman and Cairns-Smith 1987), or anaerobic photosynthetic Fe(II) oxidation (e.g., Hartman 1984; Widdel et al. 1993; Ehrenreich and Widdel 1994). Iron oxides produced by oxidation of Fe(II) represent an important sink for Fe released by terrestrial weathering processes, which will generally be quite reactive. In turn, dissimilatory microbial reduction of ferric oxides, coupled to oxidation of organic carbon and/or H2, is an important process by which Fe(III) is reduced in both modern and ancient sedimentary environments (Lovley 1991; Nealson and Saffarini 1994). Recent microbiological evidence (Vargas et al. 1998), together with a wealth of geochemical information, suggests that microbial Fe(III) reduction may have been one of the earliest forms of respiration on Earth. It therefore seems inescapable that biological redox cycling of Fe has occurred for at least several billion years of Earths history. Signifi cant Fe isotope variations in nature are generally restricted to relatively lowtemperature systems, including hydrothermal fl uids and chemically precipitated minerals (Beard and Johnson 1999; Beard et al. 1999; Zhu et al. 2000; Bullen et al. 2001; Sharma et al. 2001; Beard et al. 2003b; Johnson et al. 2003; Matthews et al. 2004). Experiments investigating metabolic processing of Fe have shown that measurable Fe isotope fractionations are produced during dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction by bacteria (Beard et al. 1999, 2003a; Icopini et al. 2004; Johnson et al. 2004a), as well as anaerobic photosynthetic Fe(II) oxidation (Croal et al. 2004). In addition, the role of organic ligands in promoting mineral dissolution has been investigated in experiments (Brantley et al. 2001, 2004). Iron isotopes may also be fractionated in abiologic systems, including ion-exchange chromatography (Anbar et al. 2000; Roe et al. 2003), abiotic precipitation of ferric oxides or oxyhydroxides (Bullen et al. 2001; Skulan et al. 2002), and sorption of aqueous Fe(II) to ferric hydroxides (Icopini et al. 2004). The largest abiotic fractionations in experiment have been measured between Fe(III) and Fe(II) species in solution, and both kinetic (Matthews et al. 2001) and equilibrium (Johnson et al. 2002; Welch et al. 2003) fractionations have been observed. In this chapter we review some of the major pathways of biological Fe metabolism, and discuss experimental studies that have investigated Fe isotope fractionations in several systems. We largely focus on the results from experiments because our goal is to understand Fe isotope fractionations at a mechanistic level. We fi nd that experimental results refl ect both kinetic and equilibrium effects, sometimes in the same experiment, making it important to scale laboratory results to the kinetic realm of natural environments. An important concept that we develop is consideration of the residence time of Fe in the various reservoirs involved in biological processing of Fe relative to the timescales of isotopic exchange; this, in addition to evaluating the isotopic mass balance in a system, form the underpinnings for understanding the measured Fe isotope fractionations in experimental studies. We compare Fe isotope fractionations that are produced in abiologic and biologic systems, looking to situations where isotopic variations produced by biochemical cycling of Fe is likely to be found in nature. Throughout the chapter, we highlight some areas of future research that are critical to our understanding of Fe isotope geochemistry and its uses in tracing biogeochemical cycling of Fe.},

Energy liberation begins with the decomposition of organic macromolecules to relatively simple compounds, which are simplified further by fermentation. Methanogenesis is considered next because CH4 is a product of acetate fermentation, and thus completes the catabolism of organic matter, particularly in the absence of inorganic electron acceptors. Finally, the organisms that use nitrogen, manganese, iron, and sulfur for terminal electron acceptors are considered in order of decreasing free-energy yield of the reactions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Marcellus Shale is considered to be the largest unconventional shale-gas resource in the United States. Two critical factors for unconventional shale reservoirs are the response of a unit to hydraulic fracture stimulation and gas content. The fracture attributes reflect the geomechanical properties of the rocks, which are partly related to rock mineralogy. The natural gas content of a shale reservoir rock is strongly linked to organic matter content, measured by total organic carbon (TOC). A mudstone lithofacies is a vertically and laterally continuous zone with similar mineral composition, rock geomechanical properties, and TOC content. Core, log, and seismic data were used to build a three-dimensional (3-D) mudrock lithofacies model from core to wells and, finally, to regional scale. An artificial neural networkwas used for lithofacies prediction. Eight petrophysical parameters derived from conventional logs were determined as critical inputs. Advanced logs, such as pulsed neutron spectroscopy,with log-determined mineral composition and TOC data were used to improve and confirm the quantitative relationship between conventional logs and lithofacies. Sequential indicator simulation performed well for 3-D modeling of Marcellus Shale lithofacies. The interplay of dilution by terrigenous detritus, organic matter productivity, and organic matter preservation and decomposition affected the distribution of Marcellus Shale lithofacies distribution, which may be attributed to water depth and the distance to shoreline. The trend of normalized average gas production rate from horizontal wells supported our approach to modeling Marcellus Shale lithofacies. The proposed 3-D modeling approach may be helpful for optimizing the design of horizontal well trajectories and hydraulic fracture stimulation strategies.},

abstract = {Laboratory assays of methanotroph activity in upland (i.e., well-drained, oxic) ecosystems alter soil physical structure and weaken inference about environmental controls of their natural behavior. To overcome these limitations, we developed a chamber-based approach to quantify methanotroph activity in situ on the basis of measures of soil diffusivity (from additions of an inert tracer gas to the chamber headspace), methane concentration change, and analysis of results with a reaction-diffusion model. The analytic solution to this model predicts that methane consumption rates are equally sensitive to changes in methanotroph activity and diffusivity, but that doubling either of these parameters leads to only a √2 increase in consumption. With a series of simulations, we generate guidelines for field deployments and show that the approach is robust to plausible departures from assumptions. We applied the approach on a dry grassland in north central Colorado. Our model closely fit measured changes in methane concentrations, indicating that we had accurately characterized the biophysical processes underlying methane uptake. Field patterns showed that, over a 7-week period, soil moisture fell from 38{\%} to 15{\%} water-filled pore spaces, and diffusivity doubled as the larger soil pores drained of water. However, methane uptake rates fell by ∼40{\%}, following a 90{\%} decrease in methanotroph activity, suggesting that the decline in methanotroph activity resulted from water stress to methanotrophs. We anticipate that future application of this approach over longer timescales and on more diverse field sites has potential to provide important insights into the ecology of methanotrophs in upland soils.},

In this work, an Ethane-Mini spectrometer has been integrated into two mobile sampling platforms, a ground vehicle and a small airplane, and used to measure ethane/methane enhancement ratios downwind of methane sources. Methane emissions with precisely known sources are shown to have ethane/methane enhancement ratios that differ greatly depending on the source type. Large differences between biogenic and thermogenic sources are observed. Variation within thermogenic sources are detected and tabulated. Methane emitters are classified by their expected ethane content. Categories include the following: biogenic ({\textless}0.2{\%}), dry gas (1-6{\%}), wet gas ({\textgreater}6{\%}), pipeline grade natural gas ({\textless}15{\%}), and processed natural gas liquids ({\textgreater}30{\%}).

abstract = {We conducted measurements of methane (CH4) emission and ecosystem respiration on {\textgreater}200 points across the Arctic coastal tundra near Barrow, Alaska, United States, in July 2007 and August 2008. This site contains broad diversity in tundra microtopography, including polygonal tundra, thaw lakes, and drained lake basins. In 2007, we surveyed CH4 emissions across this landscape, and found that soil water content was the strongest control of methane emission rate, such that emission rates rose exponentially with water content. However, there was considerable residual variation in CH4 emission in the wettest soils ({\textgreater}80{\%} volumetric water content) where CH4 emissions were highest. A statistical analysis of possible soil and plant controls on CH4 emission rates from these wet soils revealed that vegetation height (especially of Carex aquatilis) was the best predictor, with ecosystem respiration and permafrost depth as significant copredictors. To evaluate whether plant height served as a proxy for aboveground plant biomass, or gross primary production, we conducted a survey of CH4 emission rates from wet, Carex‐dominated sites in 2008, coincidently measuring these candidate predictors. Surprisingly, vegetation height remained the best predictor of CH4 emission rates, with CH4 emissions rising exponentially with vegetation height. We hypothesize that taller plants have more extensive root systems that both stimulate more methanogenesis and conduct more pore water CH4 to the atmosphere. We anticipate that the magnitude of the climate change–CH4 feedback in the Arctic Coastal Plain will strongly depend on how permafrost thaw alters the ecology of Carex aquatilis.},

abstract = {Understanding factors that control methane exchange between soils and the atmosphere remains one of the highest priorities for climate change research. Here we use a novel isotope-based technique to investigate the relative importance of three mechanisms for explaining landscape-scale variations in soil methane emissions: (1) consumption of methane by methanotrophic bacteria, (2) quantity of carbon mineralization, or (3) relative amounts of carbon flow through nonmethanogenic versus methanogenic mineralization pathways. Application of a new, nondisruptive, 13CH4 isotope pool dilution technique permitted us to evaluate these mechanisms by distinguishing gross methane fluxes through both productive and consumptive pathways. We quantified each of these pathways in surface soils across broad moisture gradients in tropical montane environments in the Hawaiian Islands and temperate ecosystems in the northeastern United States. We found only limited support for the consumption control hypothesis because consumption was only important in dry soils. We also failed to find support for the carbon supply hypothesis, in that rates of carbon mineralization did not explain the observed variability in net fluxes across landscapes. Rather, dramatic differences in methane production, and thus emission, depended on surprisingly small diversions of soil carbon flow from nonmethanogenic to methanogenic pathways: on average, soils were a net source of methane to the atmosphere if more than 0.04{\%} of total carbon mineralization passed through methanogenic pathways. We infer that fine-scale heterogeneity of soil redox status is critical for regulating soil methane fluxes.},

abstract = {We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6{\%} to 7.9{\%} of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30{\%} more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured—as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids—and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20{\%} greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.},

abstract = {Semiarid rangelands are a significant global sink for methane (CH4), but this sink strength may be altered by climate change. Methane uptake is sensitive to soil moisture showing a hump-shaped relationship with a distinct optimum soil moisture level. Both CO2 and temperature affect soil moisture, but the direction of CH4 uptake response may depend on if the system is below or above the soil moisture optimum. Most climate change studies on CH4 uptake have been conducted in mesic environments with soil moisture levels typically above optimum, but little is known about responses in drier systems with suboptimal soil water. We studied effects of atmospheric CO2 (ambient versus 600 ppm), and temperature (ambient versus 1.5/3.0°C warmer day/night) on CH4 uptake during two growing seasons in a full factorial semiarid grassland field experiment in Wyoming, United States. We observed typical hump-shaped relationships between CH4 uptake and water filled pore space. Averaged over a range of soil moisture conditions, CH4 uptake was not affected by elevated CO2, but significantly decreased with warming in both seasons (25{\%} in the first and 13{\%} in the second season). Warming showed the strongest reduction and elevated CO2 showed the strongest increase in CH4 uptake when soils were below optimum moisture, indicating that these effects are particularly strong when soils are dry.

abstract = {Unconventional natural gas extraction from tight sandstones, shales, and some coal-beds is typically accomplished by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that is necessary for economic development of these new hydrocarbon resources. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for contamination of shallow groundwater by stray gases, formation waters, and fracturing chemicals associated with unconventional gas exploration. A lack of sound scientific hydrogeological field observations and a scarcity of published peer-reviewed articles on the effects of both conventional and unconventional oil and gas activities on shallow groundwater make it difficult to address these issues. Here, we discuss several case studies related to both conventional and unconventional oil and gas activities illustrating how under some circumstances stray or fugitive gas from deep gas-rich formations has migrated from the subsurface into shallow aquifers and how it has affected groundwater quality. Examples include impacts of uncemented well annuli in areas of historic drilling operations, effects related to poor cement bonding in both new and old hydrocarbon wells, and ineffective cementing practices. We also summarize studies describing how structural features influence the role of natural and induced fractures as contaminant fluid migration pathways. On the basis of these studies, we identify two areas where field-focused research is urgently needed to fill current science gaps related to unconventional gas extraction: (1) baseline geochemical mapping (with time series sampling from a sufficient network of groundwater monitoring wells) and (2) field testing of potential mechanisms and pathways by which hydrocarbon gases, reservoir fluids, and fracturing chemicals might potentially invade and contaminate useable groundwater.},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing has made vast quantities of natural gas from shale available, reshaping the energy landscape of the United States. Extracting shale gas, however, generates large, unavoidable volumes of wastewater, which to date lacks accurate quantification. For the Marcellus shale, by far the largest shale gas resource in the United States, we quantify gas and wastewater production using data from 2189 wells located throughout Pennsylvania. Contrary to current perceptions, Marcellus wells produce significantly less wastewater per unit gas recovered (approximately 35{\%}) compared to conventional natural gas wells. Further, well operators classified only 32.3{\%} of wastewater from Marcellus wells as flowback from hydraulic fracturing; most wastewater was classified as brine, generated over multiple years. Despite producing less wastewater per unit gas, developing the Marcellus shale has increased the total wastewater generated in the region by approximately 570{\%} since 2004, overwhelming current wastewater disposal infrastructure capacity.},

abstract = {Abstract The recent increase in the use of denatured fuel-grade ethanol (DFE) has enhanced the probability of its environmental release. Due to the highly labile nature of ethanol (EtOH), it is expected to rapidly biodegrade, increasing the potential for inducing methanogenic conditions in the subsurface. As environmental releases of DFE can be expected to occur at the ground surface or in the vadose zone (e.g., due to surficial spills from rail lines or tanker trucks and leaking underground storage tanks), the potential for methane (CH4) generation at DFE spill sites requires evaluation. An assessment is needed because high CH4 generation rates may lead to CH4 fluxes towards the ground surface, which is of particular concern if spills are located close to human habitation—related to concerns of soil vapor intrusion (SVI). This work demonstrates, for the first time, the measurement of surficial gas release rates at large volume DFE spill sites. Two study sites, near Cambria and Balaton, in MN are investigated. Total carbon emissions at the ground surface (summing carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 emissions) are used to quantify depth-integrated DFE degradation rates. Results from both sites demonstrate that substantial CO2 and CH4 emissions do occur—even years after a spill. However, large total carbon fluxes, and CH4 emissions in particular, were restricted to a localized area within the DFE source zone. At the Balaton site, estimates of total DFE carbon losses in the source zone ranged between 5 and 174 $\mu$mol m− 2 s− 1, and CH4 effluxes ranged between non-detect and 9 $\mu$mol m− 2 s− 1. At the Cambria site estimates of total DFE carbon losses in the source zone ranged between 8 and 500 $\mu$mol m− 2 s− 1, and CH4 effluxes ranged between non-detect and 393 $\mu$mol m− 2 s− 1. Substantial CH4 accumulation, coupled with oxygen (O2) depletion, measured in samples collected from custom-designed gas collection chambers at the Cambria site suggests that the development of explosion or asphyxiation hazards is possible in confined spaces above a rapidly degrading DFE release. However, the results also indicate that the development of such hazards is locally constrained, will require a high degree of soil moisture, close proximity to the source zone, a good connection between the soil and the confined space, and poorly aerated conditions.},

abstract = {Measurement of the isotopic composition of soil and soil-respired CO2 ({\&}{\#}948; 13CO2) has become an invaluable tool in understanding ecosystem carbon-cycling processes. While steady state work has been indispensable in understanding the effects of diffusive transport on soil CO2 isotopic composition, it is crucial that researchers studying temporally dependent processes, such as soil CO2 efflux, realize that these systems are rarely at steady state. Non-steady-state effects could result in misinterpretation of isotopic data, but have not been addressed in the literature, despite their fundamental importance to researchers who use isotopes in diffusive, non-steady-state environments. Here, we use an isotopologue-based model to study dynamic fractionation, which we propose is a byproduct of transient changes in environmental variables. Time varying soil characteristics and processes such as biological production rate, soil pore space, diffusivity and atmospheric concentration were all found to induce non-steady-state gas transport conditions in the soil leading to transient changes in the isotopic composition of soil CO2 flux. The main driving force behind this transport related fractionation of CO2 is the rate of the change in 12CO2 gradient compared to that of 13CO2. These numerical simulations show that dynamic fractionation exists under non-steady-state diffusive conditions and suggest that isotopic data collected in non-steady-state, natural environments, cannot be properly interpreted without considering dynamic fractionation effects.},

abstract = {Drylands are considered a net sink for atmospheric methane and a main item of the global inventories of the greenhouse gas budget. It is outlined here, however, that a significant portion of drylands occur over sedimentary basins hosting natural gas and oil reservoirs, where gas migration to the surface takes place, producing positive fluxes of methane into the atmosphere. New field surveys, in different hydrocarbon-prone basins, confirm that microseepage, enhanced by faults and fractures in the rocks, overcomes the methanotrophic consumption occurring in dry soil throughout large areas, especially in the winter season. Fluxes of a few units to some tens of mg m-2 day-1 are frequent over oil-gas fields, whose global extent is estimated at 3.5-4.2millionkm2; higher fluxes ({\textgreater}50mgm-2day-1) are primarily, but not exclusively, found in basins characterized by macro-seeps. Microseepage may however potentially exist over a wider area ({\~{}}8millionkm2, i.e. 15{\%} of global drylands), including the Total Petroleum Systems, coal measures and portions of sedimentary basins that have experienced thermogenesis. Based on a relatively large and geographically dispersed data-set (563 measurements) from different hydrocarbon-prone basins in USA and Europe, upscaling suggests that global microseepage emission exceeding 10Tgyear-1 is very likely. Microseepage is then only one component of a wider class of geological sources, including mud volcanoes, seeps, geothermal and marine seepage, which cannot be ignored in the atmospheric methane budget. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The equation is similar to that of Lee and Kesler (1975) and contains fifteen parameters. It is used with a mixing rule in the following article to provide a thermodynamic model for the mixed system. Though the parameters are evaluated from the PVT data in the temperature range from 0 to 450°C for CH4, from 0 to 1000°C for CO2 and H2O, and for pressures from 0 to 3500 bar, comparison of this EOS with a large amount of experimental data in the pure systems indicates that predictions for temperatures and pressures from 0 to 1000°C and 0 to 8000 bar (or slightly above) are very nearly within experimental uncertainty. The EOS can describe both the gas and the liquid phases of the endmember systems with similar accuracy. Fugacity coefficients are derived and compiled. In this paper mixing is considered using ideal mixing based on the endmember fugacities (Amagat's rule). It is shown that such an approach leads to quite accurate predictions for high temperatures and low pressures.},

abstract = {Molecular transport (diffusion) of methane in water-saturated sedimentary rocks results in carbon isotope fractionation. In order to quantify the diffusive isotope fractionation effect and its dependence on total organic carbon (TOC) content, experimental measurements have been performed on three natural shale samples with TOC values ranging from 0.3 to 5.74{\%}. The experiments were conducted at 90??C and fluid pressures of 9 MPa (90 bar). Based on the instantaneous and cumulative composition of the diffused methane, effective diffusion coefficients of the 12CH 4 and 13CH 4 species, respectively, have been calculated. Compared with the carbon isotopic composition of the source methane (?? 13C 1 = -39.1???), a significant depletion of the heavier carbon isotope ( 13C)in the diffused methane was observed for all three shales. The degree of depletion is highest during the initial non-steady state of the diffusion process. It then gradually decreases and reaches a constant difference (??? ?? = ?? 13C diff - ?? 13C source) when approaching the steady-state. The degree of the isotopic fractionation of methane due to molecular diffusion increases with the TOC content of the shales. The carbon isotope fractionation of methane during molecular migration results practically exclusively from differences in molecular mobility (effective diffusion coefficients) of the 12CH 4 and 13CH 4 entities. No measurable solubility fractionation was observed. The experimental isotope-specific diffusion data were used in two hypothetical scenarios to illustrate extent of isotopic fractionation to be expected as a result of molecular transport in geological systems with shales of different TOC contents. The first scenario considers the progression of a diffusion front from a constant source (gas reservoir) into a homogeneous "semi-infinite" shale caprock over a period of 10 Ma. In the second example, gas diffusion across a 100 m caprock sequence is analyzed in terms of absolute quantities and isotope fractionation effects. The examples demonstrate that methane losses by molecular diffusion are small in comparison with the contents of commercial size gas accumulations. The degree of isotopic fractionation is related inversely to the quantity of diffused gas so that strong fractionation effects are only observed for relatively small portions of gas. The experimental data can be readily used in numerical basin analysis to examine the effects of diffusion-related isotopic fractionation on the composition of natural gas reservoirs.

abstract = {Laboratory experiments have been performed to determine diffusion coefficients of natural gas components (methane, ethane and nitrogen) and isotope fractionation effects under simulated in situ pressure (up to 45 MPa effective stress) and temperature conditions (50–200°C) in water-saturated pelitic and coarse-grained rocks. Effective diffusion coefficients of molecular nitrogen (0.39 × 10−11 to 21.6 × 10−11 m2 sec−1 at 90°C) are higher than those for methane (0.18 × 10−11 to 18.2 × 10−11 m2 sec−1 at 90°C). Diffusive flux rates expressed in mass units are generally higher for N2 than for CH4. Both methane and (to a lesser extent) nitrogen diffusion coefficients decrease with increasing total organic carbon (TOC) content of the rock samples because of sorption processes on the organic matter. This effect decreases with increasing temperature. Effective diffusion coefficients increase upon a temperature increase from 50 to 200°C by a factor of four. Effective diffusion coefficients and steady-state diffusive flux decrease with effective stress. Stationary diffusive fluxes drop by 50–70{\%} for methane and 45–62{\%} for nitrogen while effective diffusion coefficients are reduced by 38{\%} (CH4) and 32–48{\%} (N2), respectively. Isotope fractionation coefficients of diffusive transport are higher for methane (−1.56 and −2.77‰) than for ethane (−0.84 and −1.62‰). Application of the experimental results to geological systems show that diffusive transport has only a low transport efficiency. Significant depletion of natural gas reservoirs by molecular diffusion is only expected in cases of very poor caprock qualities (in terms of thickness and/or porosity) and over extended periods of geological time. Under these circumstances, the chemical and isotopic composition of a gas reservoir will change and maturity estimates based on these parameters may be deceptive. To account for these potential effects, nomograms have been developed to estimate diffusive losses and apply maturity corrections.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the thermohydrological conditions near high-level nuclear waste packages is needed for the design of the waste canister and for overall repository design and performance assessment. Most available studies in this area have assumed that the hydrologic properties of the host rock are not changed in response to the thermal, mechanical, or chemical effects caused by waste emplacement. However, the ramifications of this simplifying assumption have not been substantiated. We have studied dissolution and precipitation of silica in liquid-saturated hydrothermal flow systems, including changes in formation porosity and permeability. Using numerical simulation, we compare predictions of thermohydrological conditions with and without inclusion of silica redistribution effects. Two cases were studied, namely, a canister-scale problem, and a repository-wide thermal convection problem and different pore models were employed for the permeable medium (fractures with uniform or nonuniform cross sections). We find that silica redistribution in water-saturated conditions does not have a sizeable effect on host rock and canister temperatures, pore pressures, or flow velocities.},

Here we theoretically explore the internal consistency of this assumption and offer alternative forms for the Kozeny-Carman equation. The only advantage of these forms over the one traditionally used is their internal consistency. Such analytical solutions cannot replace measurements, physical and digital, but can rather serve for quality control of physical and digital data.},

It is observed that when the advection becomes dominant, the analytical solution becomes ill-behaved and harder to evaluate. Therefore another approach is designed where the solution is decomposed in a simple wave solution and a viscous pertur- bation. It is shown that an exponential layer builds up close to the downstream boundary. Discussion and comparison of both solutions are carried out extensively offering the numericist a new test model for the numerical integration of the Navier–Stokes equation.},

abstract = {This study quantitatively estimates the spatial distribution of anthropogenic methane sources in the United States by combining comprehensive atmospheric methane observations, extensive spatial datasets, and a high-resolution atmospheric transport model. Results show that current inventories from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research underestimate methane emissions nationally by a factor of ∼1.5 and ∼1.7, respectively. Our study indicates that emissions due to ruminants and manure are up to twice the magnitude of existing inventories. In addition, the discrepancy in methane source estimates is particularly pronounced in the south-central United States, where we find total emissions are ∼2.7 times greater than in most inventories and account for 24 ± 3{\%} of national emissions. The spatial patterns of our emission fluxes and observed methane–propane correlations indicate that fossil fuel extraction and refining are major contributors (45 ± 13{\%}) in the south-central United States. This result suggests that regional methane emissions due to fossil fuel extraction and processing could be 4.9 ± 2.6 times larger than in EDGAR, the most comprehensive global methane inventory. These results cast doubt on the US EPA's recent decision to downscale its estimate of national natural gas emissions by 25–30{\%}. Overall, we conclude that methane emissions associated with both the animal husbandry and fossil fuel industries have larger greenhouse gas impacts than indicated by existing inventories.},

@article{Mango1997,
abstract = {The largest petroleum fraction is between C1 and C9, the so-called light hydrocarbons (LHs). They are catagenic products, formed between ???5 and 140??C, but their mode of origin remains controversial. Although cracking enjoys broad support, there is little evidence, and inconsistencies argue against it. The higher hydrocarbons, for example, are too stable to source the LHs at these temperatures. Moreover, LHs do not resemble cracking products. Many are structurally like bio-precursors, but others are not and there s no dominance n natural structures consistent with cracking. Essentially all isomers' are found within the alkalies, cycloalkanes and aromatics with no discernible preference for natural structures. Isomer distributions are nearly constant from oil to oil and far from thermodynamic equilibrium. It is unlikely that the LHs are formed without catalytic support. Ratios of isoalkanes are almost constant in all oils and invariant within oils from a common source. This places a powerful constraint on any theory attempting to explain their origin: Certain isoheptane ratios must remain constant throughout the course of LH generation. This is inconsistent with cracking of bio-precursors and consistent with a catalytic process in which the LHs descend from a few precursors in a process controlled by steady-state kinetics. There are two opposing views on the origin of natural gas: thermal cracking and catalysis by transition metals. Non-biogenic gas contains {\~{}}85{\%} methane, but thermal cracking consistently gives products depleted in methane. Catalysis by transition metal oxides (V, Co, Fe, and Ni), on the other hand duplicates natural gas. Gas fractionation in migration might explain high-methane gas, and it has been offered as an alternative to catalysis, but there is little to support this idea and evidence against it. The opposing theories on the origin of LHs are critically reviewed here. I also review the early literature on composition the distribution of LHs in sediments, and some applications, including maturity and oil correlations.},

abstract = {[1] Photosynthesis and respiration impart distinct isotopic signatures to the atmosphere that are used to constrain global carbon source/sink estimates and partition ecosystem fluxes. Increasingly, the ‘‘Keeling plot'' method is being used to determine the carbon isotope composition of ecosystem respiration (d13CR) in order to better understand the processes controlling ecosystem isotope discrimination. In this paper we synthesize emergent patterns in d13CR by analyzing 146 Keeling plots constructed at 33 sites across North and South America. In order to interpret results from disparate studies, we discuss the assumptions underlying the Keeling plot method and recommend standardized methods for determining d13CR. These include the use of regression calculations that account for error in the x variable, and constraining estimates of d13CR to nighttime periods. We then recalculate d13CR uniformly for all sites. We found a high degree of temporal and spatial variability in C3 ecosystems, with individual observations ranging from ?19.0 to ?32.6{\%}. Mean C3 ecosystem discrimination was 18.3{\%}. Precipitation was a major driver of both temporal and spatial variability of d13CR, suggesting (1) a large influence of recently fixed carbon on ecosystem respiration and (2) a significant effect of previous climatic effects on d13CR. These results illustrate the importance of water availability as a key control on atmospheric 13CO2 and highlight the potential of d13CR as a useful tool for integrating environmental effects on dynamic canopy and ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Oil and gas exploration in the southern Appalachian basin is typically concentrated around areas with historically proven reserves and very limited prospecting is conducted elsewhere in the region. To remove possible correlation problems and promote regional prospecting a standardized picking methodology was established in geophysical logs for the Middle Ordovician carbonate lithofacies (Nashville-Stones River Groups). This methodology was then used to correlate the units across Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, from the Nashville-Jessamine domes to the Clinchport-Whiteoak Mountain thrust in the Valley and Ridge. The same lithofacies may extend in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, suggesting a standardized nomenclature be established. This methodology is key to resolving regional and local structures, and structural trends in this area. To identify deformation probably associated with blind structural trends and producing fields, regional structure contour, trend surface residual anomaly, and isopach maps were constructed using data from 7,639 geophysical logs, 1,960 drill cores, and 433 surface contacts. These maps correlate well with known producing fields and identified a possible d{\'{e}}collement in the Chattanooga Shale along with the southern extension of the Rome trough in Tennessee. A geologic model for hydrocarbon emplacement was constructed to accommodate all the available structural and petroleum information. The model illustrates a proposed d{\'{e}}collement soled in the Chattanooga Shale that forms linear potential Mississippian-age traps and a previously unidentified continuation of the Rome trough and Sequatchie Valley fault beneath the western section of the Wartburg basin in Tennessee. The Flynn Creek impact structure was also investigated because it has a good hydrocarbon potential and may have economical reserves. The impact occurred in a carbonate-dominated target during the Late Devonian. Four persistent, concentric faults indicate the Flynn Creek impact structure is not asymmetric and has a diameter of 4.7 km (2.9 mi), which was calculated from the outermost partially developed fault system, or 4 km (2.5 mi) using the third fault system, which is fully developed. Both estimates are larger than the previously estimated 3.8 km.},

abstract = {High-pressure methane sorption isotherms were measured on one Paleozoic and five Mesozoic shales, considered as targets for shale gas exploration in The Netherlands. The samples varied in mineralogy, organic richness, and thermal maturity. Four of the samples were clay-rich (total clay content 60?71 wt {\%}), one contained equal amounts of clays and quartz (36 wt {\%} and 33 wt {\%}, respectively) and one was a marl sample (clays 34 wt {\%}, carbonates 49 wt {\%}). The total organic carbon contents (TOC) ranged from {\textless}1 wt {\%} to 10.5 wt {\%}, and the thermal maturity, as inferred from Rock-Eval analysis, from immature to overmature. Excess (Gibbs) sorption isotherms for methane were measured at 65 °C on dry samples up to 25 MPa. The maximum excess sorption capacities within this pressure range varied from 0.05 to 0.3 mmol/g (1.1?6.8 m3 STP/t). No correlation of excess sorption capacity with TOC was found. Low-TOC, clay-rich shales had comparable or even higher methane sorption capacities per unit rock mass (mmol/g) than organic-rich shales, and a positive correlation was found between the maximum Langmuir capacity (nL) and the clay content. This observation supports the notion that clay minerals can contribute significantly to the sorption capacity of shales. Furthermore, we demonstrate that significant errors in TOC-normalized sorption capacities may result from the uncertainties in TOC contents, especially at low TOC values. A comparison between the immature and the overmature sample (both organic-rich with equal clay contents) did not show any enhancement of the sorption capacity with thermal maturity. However, the excess sorption isotherm of the overmature sample had a distinct maximum, while no maximum was observed for the immature sample in the experimental pressure range. A Langmuir-type absolute sorption function, with a term taking the volume of the adsorbed phase explicitly into account, gave a good representation of the measured excess sorption isotherms. The three-parameter fit yielded the Langmuir parameters (nL and pL) and a nominal density value for the adsorbed phase (?ads). Two-parameter fits of nL and pL using different fixed values of ?ads are discussed.

abstract = {This contribution presents results from a laboratory study investigating the fluid (gas/water) transport properties in the matrix system of the Scandinavian Alum Shale. The maturity of the organic matter of the shale samples ranged between 0.5 and 2.4{\%} vitrinite reflectance (VRr). Gas (He, Ar, CH4) and water flow properties were determined at effective stresses ranging between 5 and 30MPa and a temperature of 45??C. The effects of different controlling factors/parameters on the fluid conductivity including permeating fluid, moisture content, anisotropy, heterogeneity, effective stress, pore pressure, and load cycling were analyzed and discussed. Pore volume measurements by helium expansion were conducted under controlled "in situ" effective stress conditions on a limited number of plugs drilled parallel and perpendicular to bedding.For Alum Shale the intrinsic permeability coefficients measured parallel and perpendicular to bedding (6??10-22-8??10-18m2) were within the range previously reported for other shales and mudstones. Permeability coefficients were strongly dependent on permeating fluid, moisture content, anisotropy, effective stress and other sample-to-sample variations. The intrinsic/absolute permeabilities measured with helium were consistently, higher (up to five times) than those measured with argon and methane. Permeability coefficients (He, CH4) measured on a dry sample were up to six times higher than those measured on an "as-received" sample, depending on effective stress. The effect of moisture on measured permeability coefficients became more significant as effective stress increased. Permeability coefficients (He, CH4) measured parallel to bedding were up to more than one order of magnitude higher than those measured perpendicular to bedding. Parallel to bedding, all samples showed a nonlinear reduction in permeability with increasing effective stress (5-30MPa). The stress dependence of permeability could be well described by an exponential relationship. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent years, methane (CH4) has received increasing scientific attention because it is the most abundant non-CO2 atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) and controls numerous chemical reactions in the troposphere and stratosphere. However, there is much that is unknown about CH4 sources and sinks and their evolution over time. Here we show that near-surface cavities in the uppermost vadose zone are now actively removing atmospheric CH4. Through seasonal geochemical tracing of air in the atmosphere, soil and underground at diverse geographic and climatic locations in Spain, our results show that complete consumption of CH4 is favoured in the subsurface atmosphere under near vapour-saturation conditions and without significant intervention of methanotrophic bacteria. Overall, our results indicate that subterranean atmospheres may be acting as sinks for atmospheric CH4 on a daily scale. However, this terrestrial sink has not yet been considered in CH4 budget balances.},

The nonlinear mathematical equation for gas migration through layered soil was linearized and solved using the partially implicit Crank Nicolson technique. Apart from source strength, concentration and pressure as functions of depth and gas emissions into the atmosphere were computed. Laboratory experiments were conducted to generate data for model calibration and verification for mono- and two-layered systems. Other model parameters were estimated using information from published literature. The model data were in agreement with laboratory test results obtained for both systems.},

abstract = {The adsorption selectivity for C1-C6 hydrocarbons in a gas mixture on a variety of adsorbents was measured at 26 and 80°C at total pressures of 1, 2 and 3 atm. The adsorption isotherm reveals that the adsorption levels are higher for organic matter than for clays, although the selectivity is similar. Coal adsorbs gases more than oil shale, kaolinite adsorbs less total gases but more methane than montmorillonite whereas activated carbon shows much stronger adsorption capacity than the other studied samples. The proportion of the adsorptive amount relative to the initial amount for each gas component at steady state condition increases with decreasing their vapor pressures (po) (from C1 to C6). The normalized adsorptive amount for each adsorbed gas increases with increasing partial pressures (pi) of the gas in the system. The trends, in the case of oil shale, follow nearly a single trend curve as the adsorption level was plotted against relative pressure (pi/p o). This confirms that the adsorption selectivity is mainly caused by variations in the vapor pressure of the gases. In addition, the measured adsorption rates of gases on the studied adsorbents can be reasonably described using the Elovich kinetic model. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reactive transport modeling is an essential tool for the analysis of coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes in Earth systems, and has additional potential to better integrate the results from focused fundamental research on Earth materials. Appropriately designed models can describe the interactions of competing processes at a range of spatial and time scales, and hence are critical for connecting the advancing capabilities for materials characterization at the atomic scale with the macroscopic behavior of complex Earth systems. Reactive transport modeling has had a significant impact on the treatment of contaminant retardation in the subsurface, the description of elemental and nutrient fluxes between major Earth reservoirs, and in the treatment of deep Earth processes such as metamorphism and magma transport. Active topics of research include the development of pore scale and hybrid, or multiple continua, models to capture the scale dependence of coupled reactive transport processes. Frontier research questions, that are only now being addressed, include the effects of chemical microenvironments, coupled thermal–mechanical–chemical processes, controls on mineral–fluid reaction rates in natural media, and scaling of reactive transport processes from the microscopic to pore to field scale.},

abstract = {Reactive-transport models contribute significantly to the field of modern geosciences. A general mathematical approach to solving models of complex biogeochemical systems is introduced. It is argued that even though mathematical models for reactive-transport simulations can be developed at various levels of approximation, the approach for their construction and application to the various compartments of the hydrosphere is fundamentally the same. The workings of coupled transport-reaction systems are described in more detail by means of examples, which demonstrate the similarities in the approach. Three models of the carbon dynamics in redox-stratified environments are compared: porous media flow problems in a coastal sediment and in a contaminated groundwater system; and a surface flow problem in a eutrophic estuary. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of such models, a Knowledge Base System for biogeochemical processes is proposed. Incorporation of the proposed knowledge base in an appropriate modeling framework, such as the Biogeochemical Reaction Network Simulator, proves an effective approach to the modeling of complex natural systems. This methodology allows for construction of multicomponent reactive-transport models applicable to a wide range of problems of interest to the geoscientist.},

abstract = {New methods and technologies for energy storage are required to make a transition to renewable energy sources; in Germany this transition is termed ‘‘Energiewende''. Subsurface georeservoirs, such as salt caverns for hydrogen, compressed air, and methane storage or porous formations for heat and gas storage, offer the possibility of hosting large amounts of energy. When employing these geological storage facilities, an adequate system and process understanding is essential in order to characterize and to predict the complex and interacting effects on other types of sub- surface use and on protected entities. In order to make optimal use of georeservoirs, a comprehensive use planning of the subsurface is required that allocates specific uses to appropriate subsurface locations. This paper presents a generic methodology on how sub- surface use planning can be conducted and how its scientific basis can be developed. Although synthetic, realistic scenarios for the use of the geological under- ground for energy storage are parameterized and numerically simulated, accounting for other kinds of subsurface use already in place. From these scenario analyses, the imposed coupled hydraulic, thermal, mechanical and chemical processes, as well as mutual effects and influences on protected entities are assessed and generalized. Based on these, a first methodology for large-scale planning of the geological subsurface considering different surface and subsur- face usage scenarios may also be derived.},

abstract = {Fractionation of carbon isotopes of methane in natural gas due to mass transport is evaluated based on statistical thermodynamics, microkinetics and fluid dynamics analysis. A continuum flow model with coupled adsorption/desorption and diffusion is defined and calibrated to describe isotope fractionation of natural gas due to flux in low permeability rocks. Isotopic fractionations due to post-generation mass transport are evaluated with analytical and numerical solutions under different conditions.Calculations strongly suggest that isotopic fractionation in adsorption/desorption systems are mostly dominated by mass transport, rather than the fractionation between adsorbate phase and gas phase. At steady state, the fractionation is determined by the drop of partial pressure and the diffusivity difference of the isotopologues. At non-steady state, the coupling of adsorption/desorption may bring about non-linear deviation of isotope fractionation. Stronger adsorption affinity and larger adsorption capacity result in a remarkably negative isotopic composition of early gas, but this is not the case of the weak adsorption of methane on organic matter. Large isotopic fractionation due to gas transport may happen under laboratory conditions with sufficient degassing, but the fractionation is limited under geological conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

It assesses 137 shale formations in 41 countries outside the United States, expanding on the 69 shale formations within 32 countries considered in the prior report. The earlier assessment, also prepared by Advanced Resources International (ARI), was released as part of a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report titled World Shale Gas Resources: An Initial Assessment of 14 Regions Outside the United States.1 There were two reasons for pursuing an updated assessment of shale resources so soon after the prior report. First, geologic research and well drilling results not available for use in the 2011 report allow for a more informed evaluation of the shale formations covered in that report as well as other shale formations that it did not assess. Second, while the 2011 report focused exclusively on natural gas, recent developments in the United States highlight the role of shale formations and other tight plays as sources of crude oil, lease condensates, and a variety of liquids processed from wet natural gas. As shown in Table 1, estimates in the updated report taken in conjunction with EIA's own assessment of resources within the United States indicate technically recoverable resources of 345 billion barrels of world shale oil resources and 7,299 trillion cubic feet of world shale gas resources. The new global shale gas resource estimate is 10 percent higher than the estimate in the 2011 report.},

abstract = {The migration mechanisms of endogenous gases in the geosphere are defined in relation to the fluid-rock conditions and analyzed by basic transport equations. Upon examining the geological factors that influence the physical parameters in the equations in porous and fracture media, and considering the widespread high-permeability of deep subsurface rocks, in terms of fracture aperture, (orders of 10-2 to 101 mm at depths of thousands meters, as suggested by recent crustal surveys) advection of carrier gases, in its several forms (gas-phase flow, water displacement by gas, gas slugs and bubbles) seems to represent a major migration process. Accordingly, in contrast with early views, the role of gas diffusion and water advection in the transport of endogenous gas to the Earth surface should be strongly minimized in many contexts. In a wide range of geological settings, carrier gases (CO2, CH4) may assume a dominant role in controlling transport and redistribution toward the Earth's surface of trace gases (Rn, He). Bubble movement in fissured rocks seems to be an effective way of rapid (gas velocities in the order of 100 to 103 m per day) and long-distance gas migration. The evolution from bubble regimes to continuous phase flow and vice versa, as gas pressure and fracture width change, is the most suitable mechanism towards determining the surface geochemical processes of seismo-tectonic, environmental and geo-exploration relevance. The transport effectiveness of trace gases by a carrier gas has yet to be studied in quantitative terms. It is already clear, however, that further studies on the distribution and behavior of trace gases approaching the Earth's surface may not be meaningful unless accompanied by carrier gas dynamics analyses. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Results from modeling of microseepage are presented that suggest that under proper conditions some thermogenic CH 4 is transported to the atmosphere without complete consumption by methanotrophic bacteria in soils. These computer simulations are supported by direct measurement of CH 4 fluxes in seasonally dry and/or cold climate sedimentary basins where losses to the atmosphere were postulated to occur. Measurements in four semiarid sedimentary basins where a thermogenic CH 4 source is expected found small positive fluxes during cooler/drier seasons and negative fluxes during warmer/wetter seasons. Small positive fluxes up to 43 mg CH 4 m -2 d -• were found. A similar result was found for two geothermal areas in a semiarid climate where CH 4 derived from the Fischer-Tropsch reaction operating in the reservoir provides a deep source of CH 4. The results of the computer simulations, and direct field measurement of CH 4 fluxes in dry and/or cold terrestrial environments suggest that a portion of the global atmospheric budget of CH 4 may be from microseepage.},

abstract = {The debate surrounding the safety of shale gas development in the Appalachian Basin has generated increased awareness of drinking water quality in rural communities. Concerns include the potential for migration of stray gas, metal-rich formation brines, and hydraulic fracturing and/or flowback fluids to drinking water aquifers. A critical question common to these environmental risks is the hydraulic connectivity between the shale gas formations and the overlying shallow drinking water aquifers. We present geochemical evidence from northeastern Pennsylvania showing that pathways, unrelated to recent drilling activities, exist in some locations between deep underlying formations and shallow drinking water aquifers. Integration of chemical data (Br, Cl, Na, Ba, Sr, and Li) and isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 2H/H, 18O/16O, and 228Ra/226Ra) from this and previous studies in 426 shallow groundwater samples and 83 northern Appalachian brine samples suggest that mixing relationships between shallow ground water and a deep formation brine causes groundwater salinization in some locations. The strong geochemical fingerprint in the salinized (Cl {\textgreater} 20 mg/L) groundwater sampled from the Alluvium, Catskill, and Lock Haven aquifers suggests possible migration of Marcellus brine through naturally occurring pathways. The occurrences of saline water do not correlate with the location of shale-gas wells and are consistent with reported data before rapid shale-gas development in the region; however, the presence of these fluids suggests conductive pathways and specific geostructural and/or hydrodynamic regimes in northeastern Pennsylvania that are at increased risk for contamination of shallow drinking water resources, particularly by fugitive gases, because of natural hydraulic connections to deeper formations.},

abstract = {The wettability in gas-liquid-rock systems, including geothermal (steam-water-rock) systems, is central to defining the relative permeability and capillary pressure, which govern the forecasts of future production and reinjection performance. Since the frequently used Amott and USBM approaches are appropriate only for specific liquid-liquid-rock systems, we developed a model to evaluate the wettability in gas-liquid-rock systems. The method can be applied to determine the wettability at specific wetting-phase saturation if the capillary pressure and relative permeability at this fluid saturation are known. The proposed model can also be used in liquid-liquid-rock systems. The validity of the technique was tested qualitatively and quantitatively using experimental data from different rock-fluid systems. The calculated wettability indices in gas-liquid-rock systems were higher than in liquid-liquid-rock systems, as expected. Results also show that the wettability index calculated using the new method may or may not be independent of fluid saturation in the cases studied. In addition, the wettability index in drainage was seen to be greater than that in imbibition, a wettability difference that is particularly important in steam-water-rock (geothermal) systems because of the impact on reinjection. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study proposes a numerical simulation approach without direct specification of relative permeability functions. Using this approach, it is not necessary to impose relative permeability functions as input to the simulator in order to conduct the numerical simulations of two-phase fluid flow. Instead only capillary pressure data need to be imposed and the relative permeabilities can be calculated consistently using specific models. Example numerical simulations at both core and reservoir scales were conducted to test the technique without the direct input of relative permeability functions from experimental data. The results showed that the production performance calculated from the numerical simulations without the input of relative permeability functions was almost the same as the experimental data. Using the method proposed in this study, the effects of pore size distribution index and entry capillary pressure on oil recovery by gravity drainage were investigated numerically at both core scale and reservoir scale. The technique may be especially suitable for reservoirs in which it is difficult to measure relative permeability curves. Such reservoirs include gas-condensate reservoirs, extremely low permeability reservoirs, and geothermal reservoirs. The proposed technique may also be useful to upscaling, numerical simulation while drilling, and other areas. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A numerical simulation framework for coupled multiphase flow, multicomponent transport and geochemical reactions in porous media is presented. The approach is an element-based formulation that combines the compositional modeling capabilities used in oil reservoir simulation with the treatment of chemical reactions used in groundwater modeling. The procedure employs a conservative finite-volume method with a fully-implicit treatment in time in order to preserve the nonlinear coupling of flow, transport, reactions, and mass transfer across phases. Phase behavior is described using cubic equations of state. In this framework, all the governing equations and associated constraints are cast in discrete residual form, such that any variable, or coefficient, can depend on any other variable in the problem. Prior to linearization, which is applied to construct the Jacobian matrix, no algebraic or analytic manipulation need be performed to reduce the nonlinear sets of equations and unknowns. Once the complete Jacobian matrix is assembled, a series of algebraic reductions (Schur complements), of the type used in compositional reservoir simulation, are performed to reduce the number of discrete equations that must be solved simultaneously. A GMRES solution strategy with CPR (Constrained Pressure Residual) preconditioning is applied to solve the reduced linear system. We demonstrate the formulation using two CO 2 sequestration problems, one of which involves chemical reactions. The simulations demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the overall procedure for modeling the long-term fate of sequestered CO 2. ?? 2012.},

@article{Silin2009a,
abstract = {This work is motivated by the growing interest in injecting carbon dioxide into deep geological formations as a means of avoiding its atmospheric emissions and consequent global warming. Ideally, the injected greenhouse gas stays in the injection zone for a geologic time, eventually dissolves in the formation brine and remains trapped by mineralization. However, one of the potential problems associated with the geologic method of sequestration is that naturally present or inadvertently created conduits in the cap rock may result in a gas leakage from primary storage. Even in supercritical state, the carbon dioxide viscosity and density are lower than those of the formation brine. Buoyancy tends to drive the leaked CO2plume upward. Theoretical and experimental studies of buoyancy-driven supercritical CO2 flow, including estimation of time scales associated with plume evolution and migration, are critical for developing technology, monitoring policy, and regulations for safe carbon dioxide geologic sequestration. In this study, we obtain simple estimates of vertical plume propagation velocity taking into account the density and viscosity contrast between CO2 and brine. We describe buoyancy-driven countercurrent flow of two immiscible phases by a Buckley-Leverett type model. The model predicts that a plume of supercritical carbon dioxide in a homogeneous water-saturated porous medium does not migrate upward like a bubble in bulk water. Rather, it spreads upward until it reaches a seal or until it becomes immobile. A simple formula requiring no complex numerical calculations describes the velocity of plume propagation. This solution is a simplification of a more comprehensive theory of countercurrent plume migration [Silin, D., Patzek, T.W., Benson, S.M., 2007. A Model of Buoyancy-driven Two-phase Countercurrent Fluid Flow. Laboratory Report LBNL-62607. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA]. In a layered reservoir, the simplified solution predicts a slower plume front propagation relative to a homogeneous formation with the same harmonic mean permeability. In contrast, the model yields much higher plume propagation estimates in a high-permeability conduit like a vertical fracture. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {CO2 was injected into a coal fire burning at a depth of 15 m in the subsurface in southwestern Colorado, USA. Measurements were made of the 13CO2 isotopic signature of gas exhaust from an observation well and two surface fissures. The goal of the test was to determine (1) whether CO2 with a distinct isotopic signature could be used as a tracer to identify flow pathways and travel times in a combustion setting where CO2 was present in significant quantities in the gases being emitted from the coalbed fire, and (2) to confirm the existence of a self-propagating system of air-intake and combustion gas exhaust that has been previously proposed. CO2 was injected in three separate periods. The 13CO2 isotopic signature was measured at high frequency (0.5 Hz) before, during, and after the injection periods for gas flowing from fissures over the fire and from gas entering an observation well drilled into the formation just above the fire but near the combustion zone. In two cases, a shift in the isotopic signature of outgassing CO2 provided clear evidence that injected CO2 had traveled from the injection well to the observation point, while in a third case, no response was seen and the fissure could not be assumed to have a flowpath connected with the injection well. High-frequency measurements of the 13CO2 signature of gas in observation wells is identified as a viable technique for tracking CO2 injected into subsurface formations in real-time. In addition, a chimney-like coupled air-intake and exhaust outlet system feeding the combustion of the coal seam was confirmed. This can be used to further develop strategies for extinguishing the fire.},

abstract = {Sequence-stratigraphic conceptual models typically focus on accommodation as a dominant control. Although useful in many ways, this approach may not address the full range of possible controls on stratal patterns, nor is it likely to fully address uncertainty in the identification and quantification of controlling processes. Consequently, predictions from sequence-stratigraphic conceptual models may be more limited than generally stated. Progress in addressing this problem can be achieved by applying the latest generation three-dimensional stratigraphic forward modeling to (1) investigate and include more of the parameters that may control stratal architectures and (2) consider multiple scenarios to help determine the impact of uncertainty in operating processes and their parameter values. Results from a three-dimensional diffusional stratigraphic forward model illustrate this approach, suggesting that relative sea level change, shelf width, and sediment-transport efficiency are important large-scale controls on the spatial and temporal distribution of deep-marine stratal volumes. If this result is sufficiently independent of model assumptions and can be replicated in other models, it suggests that all three controlling factors should be included in interpretations and predictions of outcrop and subsurface deep-marine strata. Modeling results also suggest that combining multiple forward-model scenarios to form conditional frequency maps may be a useful, practical method to present and analyze multiple scenarios. The use of multiple forward-modeling scenarios to consider multiple controls on stratal architecture could begin to account more fully for uncertainty in controlling processes and parameter values, in sequence stratigraphy generally, and evaluation of subsurface uncertainty specifically.},

abstract = {Numerical experiments in an idealized river mouth are conducted using a three-dimensional hydrodynamics model (EFDC model) to examine the impacts of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), settling velocity of sediment and tidal mixing on the formation and maintenance of estuarine hyperpycnal flows. The standard experiment presents an illustrative view of hyperpycnal flows that carry high-concentrated sediment and low-salinity water in the bottom layer ({\textgreater}1.0 m in thickness) along the subaqueous slope. The structure and intra-tidal variation of the simulated hyperpycnal flows are quite similar to those previously observed off the Huanghe (Yellow River) mouth. Results from the three control experiments show that SSC of river effluents is the most important parameter to the formation of hyperpycnal flows. High SSC will increase the bulk density of river effluents and thus offset the density difference between freshwater and seawater. Low SSC of river effluents will produce a surface river plume, as commonly observed in most large estuaries. Both the settling velocity of sediment particles and the tidal mixing play an important role in maintaining the hyperpycnal flows. Increasing settling velocity enhances the deposition of sediment from the hyperpycnal layer and thus accelerates the attenuation of hyperpycnal flows, whereas increasing tidal mixing destroys the stratification of water column and therefore makes the hyperpycnal flows less evident. Our results from numerical experiments are of importance to understand the initiation and maintenance of hyperpycnal flows in estuaries and provide a reference to the rapidly decaying hyperpycnal flows off the Huanghe river mouth due to climatic and anthropogenic forcing over the past several decades. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Eight survey cruises in different seasons have been conducted in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) during the period from 2000 to 2008. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and hydrological data were collected during each cruise. Data analysis showed that total suspended sediment mass was approximately 0.18 × 109 tons in the surveyed area during spring and autumn seasons. Highly turbid waters were found in the shallow waters between the Subei coast, the Changjiang estuary and the Zhejiang coast with seasonal variations.The investigation provided convincing evidence that suspended sediments were transported from the Subei coast and the southern entrance of the Yellow Sea Trough to the central YS. Muddy patches were found at the sea bed when tidal currents were too weak to erode the bottom sediments and water column stratification and eddies provided favorable conditions for trapping the fine-grained suspended sediments.The investigation indicated that the different front may have different effect on sediment transport during different seasons. The front between the Yellow Sea Cold Water and the coastal water in the Subei coast appeared to trap the high SSC sediments on the shallow water side of the front. During summer, the front along the Zhejiang coast seemed to prevent suspended sediments from transport across the front due to circulation in the front zone and upwelling along the Zhejiang coast. During winter, sediments were likely transported across the front to the central continental shelf of the ECS with the help of the downwelling and lateral Ekman transport driven by monsoon winds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Observations from several shelf environments show that down-slope gravity-driven transport may constitute an important mode of suspended sediment dispersal across shelves and highlight the influence of ambient waves and currents on gravity-induced sediment flux. The phenomena discussed here involve high concentrations of suspended sediment mixed with seawater and thus differ in genesis from hyperpycnal plumes released directly from sediment-laden rivers. The field sites examined are the Gulf of Bohai off the mouth of the Yellow River (Huanghe), the northern California shelf off the mouth of the Eel River, and the Louisiana shelf west of the mouths of the Mississippi River. Off the Yellow River, rapid down-slope transport over distances of a few km occurred when frictional resistance, induced by strong along shelf currents, was temporarily relaxed. More prolonged down-slope motion over longer distances occurred following floods of the Eel River, when wave and current agitation provided turbulence to sustain gravity-driven transport of fluid mud. On the Louisiana inner shelf, the down-slope gravity force was much weaker, but observations suggest that thin gravity flows may still have occurred in the presence of waves. A simple analytical theory is developed that incorporates the influence of ambient shelf currents on gravity-driven transport of suspended sediment. This theory is quantitatively consistent with the observations from the three sites. If the supply of easily suspended sediment is less than the capacity of ambient currents (including waves) to carry sediment, then intense turbulence limits gravity-induced sediment transport by increasing the drag at the base of the flow. When ambient currents abruptly cease, rapid down-slope transport can then occur over short distances until the sediment settles. Such flows do not remain intensely turbulent because the slope of the continental shelf is too gentle to induce shear instability within the gravity flow. The maximum sustained rate of gravity-induced sediment transport occurs when ambient currents are strong, but the supply of easily suspended sediment exceeds the resuspension capacity of the ambient currents. Feedback then leads to values of the gradient Richardson number (Ri) within the flow that are near the critical value of 1/4. This partially damps bottom drag, but still allows the generation of sufficient turbulence to maintain sediment in suspension. Observations also indicate systematic relationships among Ri, the supply of easily suspended sediment and the bottom drag coefficient acting on the gravity flow.},

abstract = {Field observations of shoreface benthic processes made in the Middle Atlantic Bight off Duck, N.C. and on the Eel River shelf off northern California have yielded several types of evidence that gravity-induced downslope transport of suspended sediment may constitute an important, but episodic, mode of across-shelf transport during storms. Observed manifestations of the inferred gravity flows include side scan images showing abrupt interfaces between fine sediment "blankets" and coarser sands, rapid bed accretion during the waning phases of storms and short-lived periods of accelerated seaward sediment flux following groups of higher waves. To explore the possibility that gravity-driven transport may be episodically significant in energetic shoreface and shelf environments, we applied a relatively simple analytical model that considers the effects of wave and current turbulent friction in modulating the downslope response of turbidity-induced gravity currents as well as in suspending sediment to produce negative buoyancy. The theory was applied to data on benthic flows from three phases of a storm event off Duck in October 1994. Results indicate that the gradient Richardson number, Ri, remained appreciably below the critical value of 0.25 during average conditions and during high wave groups. During lulls, however, Ri briefly became supercritical within a few tens of centimeters above the bed implying short-lived turbulence suppression. On the Eel River shelf, direct observations show that, within the thin ((O)10 cm) muddy layer, Ri values also fluctuated between subcritical ({\textless} 1/4) during groups and supercritical ({\textgreater} 1/4) during lulls again implying that stratification suppressed production of turbulence during lulls. Downslope transport was observed during both high and low wave packets but accelerated during lulls as in the Duck case. We conclude that gravity-induced downslope transport of sediment suspended by waves is likely to be an important mode of across-shelf transport on the inner shelf of energetic sandy environments and the mid-shelf of energetic muddy environments. Such transports are most likely pulsational, with high turbidities and buoyancy anomalies being created by the high stresses associated with groups of large waves and moderately rapid but brief downslope movement occurring when bed stresses are temporarily relaxed during the lulls between high groups. This mechanism operates out of phase with group-forced long waves. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A 2 m-thick diamictite occurs near the base of the Cretaceous Eromanga Basin succession at Trinity Well, at the northern extremity of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. The diamictite consists of a matrix of silt- and clay-size particles and a framework of sand and coarser materials up to small boulder size. Scanning electron microscope study reveals the presence of numerous quartz grains displaying extreme angularity and surface textures attributed to glacial crushing. Sandy sediments considered as fluvioglacial in origin and a locally developed facies displaying flow structures attributed to solifluction processes constitute the basal 3–5 m of the sequence. In places these directly underlie the diamictite and rest with angularity on Neoproterozoic Adelaidean strata. Conformably above the diamictite at the type locality ‘Recorder Hill' is a sequence approximately 15 m thick of fine sand and silt units containing lonestones up to ∼70 cm diameter and hummocky cross-stratification. These sediments have been assigned to the Cadna-owie Formation and are dated on palynology as Berriasian to Valanginian. The occurrence of diamictite containing glacially affected quartz grains contributes to our interpretation that the southern margin of the Eromanga Basin, and at least the adjacent part of the northern Flinders Ranges, were affected by glaciation in the Early Cretaceous. The associated dropstone and solifluction facies and nearby glendonite pseudomorphs after ikaite are further evidence of at least intermittent cold climates at this time.},

abstract = {The evolution of a tidal-current field in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YECS) in response to the sea-level rise since the last glacial maximum (LGM) was investigated using a two-dimensional tidal model, with special attention to changes in the sedimentary environment of the continental shelf region. It was found that tidal currents on the YECS shelf have generally been semi-diurnal throughout the post glacial stages, with F-ratio (index of diurnal inequality) and S2/M2 ratio (index of spring-neap cycle) remaining similar to present. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of the tidal bottom stress associated with M2 and M4 tidal currents changed greatly during the transgression. As the sea level rose, two core regions showing high bottom-stress values migrated shoreward from Cheju Island toward the west coast of Korea, and along the retreat path of the paleo-Changjiang Estuary. Distribution of 'extremely intense' tidal bottom stress suggested that intense tidal reworking may have occurred at sea levels from -90 to -45 m in the southeast Yellow Sea and at -75 to -60 m off the paleo-Changjiang Estuary, the latter of which agreed with the timing of a large terrigenous organic C flux observed on the shelf slope. Distribution of slightly weaker bottom stress indicated that the sand ridges off the Changjiang Estuary and in the southeast Yellow Sea also might have formed at during those periods. On the other hand, when the sea level was between -45 and-15 m, the tidal bottom stress was generally not strong enough to invoke significant reworking, even though the stress intensity may be stronger than present. Correlation with modern and relict sedimentary features suggested that the tidal process have played a significant role on the reworking and deposition of sediments on the YECS shelf. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent field observations from several shelf environments show that gravity-driven transport within negatively buoyant layers is an important mode of fine sediment transport across continental shelves. Specifically, Dick Sternberg, along with his students and colleagues, stimulated a paradigm shift by reporting strong evidence from the Amazon and Eel shelves that hyperpycnal layers do not require autosuspension for sustenance but can be initiated by sediment flux convergence and supported by wave and current-induced suspension within relatively thin near-bed layers. As these layers move downslope under the influence of gravity, they may deposit sediment in response to decreases in bottom orbital velocities, near-bed current velocity, and/or bed slope. Direct or indirect evidence for wave or current supported sediment gravity flows has recently been reported off other high-load rivers including the Atchafalaya, Fly, Ganges–Brahmaputra, Klamath, Mad, Mississippi, Po, Rhone, Waiapu, Waipaoa, Yangtze, and Yellow among others. Growing evidence from observational and modeling studies suggests that flux convergence followed by wave and current supported gravity driven transport is a primary cause of across-shelf transport and emplacement of flood deposits on many muddy shelves and may be a major contributor to and control on the large-scale formation and morphology of subaqueous deltas and shelf clinoforms. Recent and ongoing studies on this subject are synthesized in this paper and recommendations are offered for further study.},

abstract = {The processes responsible for the transport and deposition of concentrated suspended silts over the delta front of the Huanghe were observed during three cruises and have been modeled numerically. Suspended sediment concentrations in the lower Huanghe average about 25 kg m−3 and exceed 200 kg m−3 during flood stage. Cruises were conducted during normal discharge conditions in spring 1985 and summer 1986, and during low-discharge storm-dominated conditions in autumn 1987. During the first two cruises, the shallow delta-front top (depth≤ 5m) was covered by a turbid water mass with suspended sediment concentrations of 1–10 kg m−3. Strong (∼1m s−1) parabathic tidal currents resuspended newly deposited muds and advected them alongshore. Near a break in slope, the turbid layers plunged beneath the ambient water and descended the delta-front slope as gravity-driven hyperpycnal underflows. In 1987 the hyperpycnal underflows occurred only during an intense strom that resuspended delta-front sediments to produce underflows with concentrations on the order of 100 kg m−3. We infer that gravity-driven underflows constitute the most important mode of suspended sediment transport across isobaths. Concentrated and channelized “point source” underflows, apparently associated with flood conditions, were not observed but were inferred from morphological evidence and were modeled numerically. Modeling results show that the Coriolis force and ambient momentum should cause appreciable curvature to the paths of underflows, while entrainment of ambient mass contributes to underflow decay. Early extinction of all underflow types is suggested by field and modeling results, and is considered to be responsible for extremely rapid delta-front deposition and for the fact that most of the sediments discharged by the Huanghe remain close to the mouth.},

abstract = {Analysis of multichannel seismic reflection profiles reveals that the northern East China Sea shelf basin experienced two phases of rifting, followed by regional subsidence. The initial rifting in the Late Cretaceous created a series of grabens and half grabens, filled by alluvial and fluviolacustrine deposits. Regional uplift and folding (Yuquan movement) in the late Eoceneearly Oligocene terminated the initial rifting. Rifting resumed in the early Oligocene, while alluvial and fluviolacustrine deposition continued to prevail. A second phase of uplift in the early Miocene terminated the rifting, marking the transition to the postrift phase. The early postrift phase (early Miocene-late Miocene) is characterized by regional subsidence and westward and northwestward marine transgression. Inversion (Longjing movement) in the late Miocene interrupted the postrift subsidence, resulting in an extensive thrust-fold belt in the eastern part of the area. The entire area entered a stage of regional subsidence again and has become a broad continental shelf.  Source rocks include synrift lacustrine facies, fluvial shales, and coal beds. Synrift fluvial, lacustrine, and deltaic deposits, postrift littoral and/or shallow-marine sandstones, and fractured basement have the potential to provide reservoirs. Various types of hydrocarbon traps (e.g., faulted anticlines, overthrusts, rollover anticlines, faults, unconformity traps, combination structural-stratigraphic traps, weathered basement, and stratigraphic traps) are recognized, but many of these traps have not been tested},

abstract = {The East China Sea Basin is located in the convergence area between the Eurasian plate, the Pacific plate and the Philippine Sea plate, and consists of two depressions, the Taibei Depression in the west and the Xihu Depression in the east. Heat flow measurements show that the East China Sea Basin is characterized by present-day heat flow around 70.6 mW/m2, varying between 55 and 88 mW/m2. No significant difference in heat flow is observed between the Xihu and the Taibei Depressions. Thermal history reconstruction using vitrinite reflectance suggests that the thermal history was, however, different in the Taibei and the Xihu Depressions. Paleo-heat flow values when the pre-Tertiary formations experienced their maximum temperature at the end of the Paleocene reached a mean of 82 mW/m 2 in the Taibei Depression, much higher than the present-day value. The lower Tertiary sediments in the Xihu Depression experienced maximum temperatures at the end of Oligocene (35.4-23.3 Ma) and reached a mean paleo-heat flow value of 83 mW/m2. Tectonic subsidence analysis shows that the timing of the major rifting episode was different across the East China Sea Basin. The rifting occurred from the Late Cretaceous (???65 Ma) to the early Eocene (???55 Ma) in the Taibei Depression, followed by thermal subsidence from the late Eocene to the end of Miocene (23.3-5.2 Ma). In contrast, in the Xihu Depression the initial subsidence lasted until the early Miocene and thermal subsidence to the end of Miocene. From Pliocene to the present, an accelerated subsidence took place all along the West Pacific margin of Asia. Significant thicknesses of strata were removed from the unconformities in the basin: the mean amount of erosion was 1147 m from the Paleocene and 1208 m above the Oligocene in the Taibei Depression, and 1409 m from the Oligocene in the Xihu Depression. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The latest round oil and gas assessment in China was completed in 2005, with the following characteristics: (1) petroleum system analyses in superimposed sedimentary basins were conducted; (2) several methodologies were simultaneously used, including mass balance, geological analogy and statistical approach; (3) contrasting criteria areas were used to optimize the assessment parameters; and (4) not only resource in place but also recoverable resource were estimated for the assessment result. The assessment on 129 onshore and offshore basins indicates that the total aggregated mean conventional gas resource in China is 43.9 trillion cubic meters (tcm) or 1549 trillion cubic feet (tcf), including 26.9, 8.1 and 8.8 tcm in onshore, nearshore and southern South China Sea basins, respectively. The total recoverable conventional gas resource is around 27.5 tcm or 970 tcf, including 16.8, 5.3 and 5.4 tcm in onshore, nearshore and far offshore basins, respectively. Most of these resources are distributed in six areas, including the onshore Tarim, Ordos, Sichuan, Qidam and Songliao basins, and the offshore areas in the East China Sea and South China Sea. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this network all grid cells in a catchment are coupled and have a flow direction, making it a useful tool in the modeling of river flow on a global scale. The flow directions are based on a digital elevation model and on information on the locations of major rivers ('stream burning'). The presented river routing network is specifically designed for the assessment of fresh water shortages. We tested the validity of the river routing network by comparing the computed drainage areas with published estimates. This comparison revealed a good similarity and it is concluded that the presented river routing network has sufficient quality to be implemented in global climate models. This could mean a considerable improvement of the surface parameterization in these models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Basin modeling and cross-section restoration from the northern East China Sea Shelf Basin reveal the timing of trap formation and petroleum generation. Cross-section restoration suggest that extension started in the Late Cretaceous and was interrupted by inversion at the end of Miocene that created large anticline structures, providing numerous petroleum traps. One-dimensional basin modeling of the JDZ-VII-I well show that the main phase of oil generation in the synrift fluvial shales in the Jeju Basin occurred during the Early Oligocene-middle Miocene period, predating the regional inversion. Thus, potential for large oil accumulations in the southern part of the basin is probably limited. Most of the petroleum are likely to have flowed toward the basin margin as well as basin center until the Late Miocene because no structures were available to capture them. The formation of anticline structures overlapped and/or postdated the main phase of gas generation in the Jeju Basin. This is probably why the JDZ-VII-1 is gas-prone with the gas trapped mainly in the anticlinal structures formed by the tectonic uplift. The source rocks in the southwestern part of the Domi Basin are immature for petroleum generation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Eocene sandstones in the northern Dongying Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China, are reservoirs for large accumulations of hydrocarbons. The sandstones are mainly lithic arkoses and feldspathic litharenites, texturally and compositionally immature. These sandstones have a wide range of porosity (0.4–37{\%}) and permeability (0.004–6969 mD) and show an overall decrease in reservoir quality from 1500 m to 5000 m below sea level. The reduction in reservoir quality is a product of several digenetic processes; these include compaction, precipitation of dolomite and calcite in eodiagenetic stage; compaction, feldspar dissolution, precipitation of quartz cements and clays (kaolin and illite) and precipitation of ferrocalcite and ankerite in mesodiagenetic stage. Mineral distribution pattern and isotopic composition suggest carbonate cements in sandstones originate from sources outside the sandstones. Carbonate cementation, together with compaction reduced the sandstones' porosity and permeability significantly. In a sandstone bed, marginal sandstones with distance to sandstone/mudstone interface less than one meter always have lower porosity than central sandstones. As burial depth exceeds 4000 m, marginal sandstones have very low porosities ({\textless}5{\%}), indicating that thin sandstone beds ({\textless}2 m) were totally destroyed by cementation and compaction, and only thick sandstone beds ({\textgreater}2 m) can be potential effective reservoirs. Feldspar dissolution and precipitation of clays and quartz cements have little impact on absolute porosity. Mineral distribution pattern and quantitative data show that leached feldspars are the internal source of authigenic quartz and clays in sandstones, and the volume difference between feldspar secondary porosity and related authigenic cements is generally less than 0.25{\%}. However, although there is little or no net import of matter to the sandstones, the pore architecture changes dramatically. Primary macropores are lost as clays and quartz precipitate while the proportion of microporosity increases, occurring mainly between clay crystals. The overall result is that permeability is significantly degraded.},

abstract = {The Scotian Basin is an under-explored offshore basin that has produced gas and minor oil from Jurassic–Cretaceous deltaic sandstones. Reservoir quality is an important exploration risk in the basin. This study evaluates whether there are systematic stratigraphic or geographic variations in diagenetic mineral assemblage control of reservoir porosity and permeability. Three data sets are used: a compilation of all available core-plug porosity and permeability measurements (3271 in total), a subset of 577 corresponding to thin sections with lithofacies assignments, and a subset of 35 thin sections principally from reservoir sandstones, in which modal abundance of diagenetic minerals has been determined by image analysis of scanning electron microscope backscattered electron images. Abundances above a 4{\%} threshold of diagenetic kaolinite, calcite and ankerite correlate inversely with permeability, but chlorite and possibly siderite correlate positively. Diagenetic assemblages show no systematic variation with stratigraphy or geography, both of which may involve variable detrital supply. Permeability shows the well-known variation with grain size and depth of burial, but after correcting for these effects it is greatest in estuarine channel and river-mouth turbidite sandstones. This is because these facies preferentially develop chlorite rims on detrital quartz grains and are also the sites of enhanced flow of late basinal fluids resulting in secondary porosity. Local effects such as facies distribution, architecture of channel sandstones, fluid pathways related to complex salt tectonics, and the effects of overpressure are more important than predictable basin-wide effects in controlling sandstone reservoir quality.},

abstract = {The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico is the first geologic repository for disposal of transuranic nuclear waste from defense-related programs of the US Department of Energy. It is constructed within halite beds of the Permian-age Salado Formation. The Culebra Dolomite, confined within Rustler Formation evaporites overlying the Salado Formation, is a potential pathway for radionuclide transport from the repository to the accessible environment in the human-disturbed repository scenario. Although extensive subsurface characterization and numerical flow modeling of groundwater has been done in the vicinity of the WIPP, few studies have used natural isotopic tracers to validate the flow models and to better understand solute transport at this site. The advent of Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) has enabled routine measurement of cosmogenic 81Kr (half-life 229,000 yr), a near-ideal tracer for long-term groundwater transport. We measured 81Kr in saline groundwater sampled from two Culebra Dolomite monitoring wells near the WIPP site, and compared 81Kr model ages with reverse particle-tracking results of well-calibrated flow models. The 81Kr model ages are {\~{}} 130,000 and {\~{}} 330,000 yr for high-transmissivity and low-transmissivity portions of the formation, respectively. Compared with flow model results which indicate a relatively young mean hydraulic age ({\~{}} 32,000 yr), the 81Kr model ages imply substantial physical attenuation of conservative solutes in the Culebra Dolomite and provide limits on the effective diffusivity of contaminants into the confining aquitards. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An overview is given of the mechanisms and processes (viscous flow, diffusion, sorption, desorption) affecting transport in unconventional reservoir rocks. Processes are described, terms and definitions are given, and selected literature data are presented to document the state of knowledge and the data situation on gas, water and two-phase flow in low-permeable lithotypes.Gas transport in the matrix of shales and coals is controlled by and may be restricted to diffusion. Depending on the gas type (e.g. methane or carbon dioxide), transport may be strongly affected by sorption. In many instances, high capillary threshold pressures prevent gas from moving as a continuous phase through the conducting pore network. In contrast, tight sandstone reservoir rocks allow for capillary-controlled viscous flow of a gas phase. Because in these rocks the determination of the water saturation at the prevailing flow conditions is difficult or impossible, we propose to directly use the relationship between effective gas permeability and capillary pressure for the description of two-phase (gas/water) flow in these rocks. In ongoing studies this relationship is being studied systematically for both, steady state and non-steady state saturation conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The investigations comprised geochemical and mineralogical analysis of the pelitic rocks, petrophysical characterisation by mercury poro- simetry and specific surface area measurements, and laboratory experiments to assess the transport properties with respect to both molecular transport (diffusion) and volume flow (Darcy flow). Effective diffusion coefficients of methane in the water-saturated rock samples at 150°C lay between 1.4x IO-” and 4.5x 10-‘ 0m2/s and showed a distinct correlation with TOC content. Permeability coefficients, measured by means of a steady-state method, ranged from {\textless} 1 nDarcy (4 loo*' m2) for Permian (Rotliegend) and Carboniferous red claystones up to 4.3 PDarcy (4.3 x 10{\~{}}‘ 8m2) for a bioturbated Jurassic siltstone. The experimental data were used to calculate maximum sustainable gas and petroleum column heights, hydrocarbon leakage rates by pressure-driven volume flow (Darcy flow), and diffusive gas losses for simple, hypothetical scenarios. Computed maximum gas column heights range from 20m up to {\textgreater}2000m. Hydrocarbon column heights calculated on the basis of a rich con- densate lay between 3 and 340 m. Depending on temperature, pressure, reservoir geometry and seal thickness, diffusive losses can be expected to require tens of millions of years to significantly affect the contents of commercial size natural gas reservoirs.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbon generation and retention processes occurring within gas shales as a response to increases in thermal maturation are still poorly constrained. While efforts have been directed at unravelling the resource potential, composition and textures of these economically important unconventional systems, their spatial variability in chemistry and structure is still poorly documented at the sub-micrometer scale. Here, we have characterized samples of the Lower Toarcian Posidonia Shale samples from northern Germany at varying stages of thermal maturation using a combination of compositional organic geochemistry and spectromicroscopy techniques, including synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). We document geochemical and mineralogical heterogeneities down to the nanometer scale within the investigated samples as a function of their level of thermal maturity. In particular, authigenic albite crystals containing nanometric halite inclusions have been documented within the investigated mature and overmature samples. The presence of such tracers of palaeobrine-carbonate interactions supports a maturation scenario for the Lower Toarcian Posidonia Shale intimately related to ascending brine fluids rather than a maturation scenario solely resulting from high heat flows. In addition, various types of asphaltene- and NSO-rich bitumen have been detected within the same samples, very likely genetically derived from thermally degraded organic precursors. Furthermore, the formation of nanoporous pyrobitumen has been inferred for samples of gas window maturity, likely resulting from the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons. By providing in-situ insights into the fate of bitumen and pyrobitumen as a response to the thermal evolution of the macromolecular structure of kerogen, the results reported here constitute an important step towards better constraining hydrocarbon generation processes during natural shale gas maturation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The transient pulse technique was used, which can measure very low permeabilities (up to 10-22 m2). Cylindrical 40 mm diameter and about 40 mm length samples come from different distances with respect to the wall of the main access shaft of the MHM URL. The relationship between the permeability and the state of stress is studied and the problem of gas transfer in the saturated sample is analyzed. The relationship between the rupture of sample and the permeability will be also discussed. Experimental (and numerical) results show that the Callovo-Oxfordian stratum of MHM has very low gas permeabilities (∼2 × 10-21 m2). The disturbance linked to the excavation of shafts is not significant. Results show that the interstice gradient of gas pressure can induce pore water displacement. Furthermore, it was found that the permeability does not change very much even if a rupture occurs in tests with a confining pressure (11 MPa) equivalent to the lithological pressure at the depth of about 467 m. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Land-ocean transfer of sediment by rivers is a key pathway for material transfer on Earth. Contemporary data on the sediment loads of rivers provide clear evidence of significant recent changes in the sediment fluxes of several rivers in response to human impact. The key drivers of increased sediment loads include land clearance for agriculture and other facets of land surface disturbance, including logging activity and mining. Although, programmes for soil conservation and sediment control can result in reduced sediment loads, the trapping of sediment by dams represents the dominant cause of reduced loads. This influence is currently assuming increasing importance at the global scale. Any attempt to link these drivers to changes in the global land-ocean sediment flux must take account of the aggregation and buffering effects that operate in larger basins, which can cause damping and even removal of signals of increasing flux within the upstream basin, and complicate the link between upstream and downstream response to human impact. Further work is required to provide a precise quantitative assessment of the human impact on global land-ocean sediment fluxes and the net effect of increasing and decreasing fluxes. Particular attention must be paid to the temporal perspective and the variation of impact trajectories in different areas of the globe and for river basins of different sizes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Marginal basins that occur behind island arcs display geological and geophysical fea- tures that imply an extensional origin and a spreading mechanism, possibly driven by the heating of the basin floor from below. The origin and evolution of these basins appear to be associated with the subduction process of the oceanic lithosphere. The mechanism we propose for the formation and spreading of marginal basins is the convective flow induced in the mantle by the subducting slab. This convective current brings hot mantle material to the base of the lithosphere behind island arcs. The combination of material upwelling, heating of the lithosphere and flow induced tension initiates spreading and the formation of marginal basins. Quantitative investigation of this mechanism has been carried out utilizing numerical calculations using both constant and variable viscosity models. Numerical results indicate that the induced flow can generate a 1 km topographic rise and a tensile stress of about 100 bars. Together with the thinning of the lithosphere due to heating, this induced cur- rent is probably sufficient to generate inter-arc spreading at about 5-10 million years after the initiation of subduction. The horizontal scale of the spreading center obtained from the numerical models is also consistent with the observations over many marginal basins.},

abstract = {The relationship between subduction and back-arc spreading has been well known since the early days of plate tectonics. However, the reasons why back-arc basins are associated with some subduction systems but not all has remained elusive. We examine the kinematic controls on subduction and back-arc basins for both the present-day and Cenozoic to differentiate between the major competing hypotheses for back-arc basin formation and to explain their temporal and spatial distribution. Our new data set of subduction and back-arc basin parameters uses a new set of paleo-oceanic age grids (M{\"{u}}ller et al., 2005) associated with a moving Atlantic-Indian Ocean hot spot reference frame (O'Neill et al., 2005). The plate model includes detailed reconstructed spreading histories of back-arc basins based on marine geophysical and satellite gravity data. Our combined rotation and oceanic paleo-age model provides the age distribution of subducting lithosphere through space and time, convergence rates, and the absolute motion of the downgoing and overriding plates. We find that back-arc basins develop when the age of subducting normal oceanic lithosphere is greater than 55 million years. Additionally, we establish an age-dip relationship showing that the intermediate dip angle of the subducting slab is always greater than 30° with back-arc spreading. Our results suggest that back-arc basin formation is always preceded by an absolute motion of the overriding plate away from the subduction hinge, thereby creating accommodation space between the overriding and subducting plates. Once back-arc extension is established, it continues regardless of overriding plate motion, indicating back-arc spreading is not a simple consequence of overriding plate behaviour. The landward migration of the overriding plate as a precursor to back-arc extension may indicate that extension on the overriding plate is influenced by the oceanward lateral flow of the mantle. However, once back-arc extension is established, rollback of the subduction hinge appears to be the primary force responsible for the continued creation of accommodation space. Our analysis indicates the driving mechanism for back-arc extension is a combination of surface kinematics, properties of the downgoing slab, the effect of lateral mantle flow on the slab, and mantle wedge dynamics.},

abstract = {To address the problem of the great variability of the mechanical$\backslash$nstate of subduction zones, we investigate the mechanics of back arc$\backslash$nspreading and seismic decoupling. Back arc spreading is assumed to$\backslash$nbe due to rifting of the upper plate and hence occurs when trench-normal$\backslash$ntension reaches a critical value. Seismic decoupling is assumed to$\backslash$noccur when the normal stress at the frictional interface is decreased$\backslash$nby an amount sufficient to cross the friction stability transition.$\backslash$nTwo forces are important in this problem. The first is a small component$\backslash$nof the slab pull force which remains unbalanced by the subduction$\backslash$nresistance and exerts a vertical suction force at the trench. The$\backslash$nsecond is a sea anchor force exerted on the slab that resists its$\backslash$nlateral motion, assumed to occur at the upper plate velocity. Both$\backslash$nforces contribute to the coupling problem: only the sea anchor force$\backslash$nis responsible for back arc spreading. The unbalanced slab pull force$\backslash$nis determined from a force balance for subduction, the sea anchor$\backslash$nforce is computed as the hydrodynamic resistance to the facewise$\backslash$ntranslation of an elliptical disc through a viscous fluid. The model$\backslash$npredicts three regimes: seismically coupled compressional arcs with$\backslash$nadvancing upper plates; seismically decoupled extensional arcs with$\backslash$nretreating upper plates, and strongly extensional arcs which also$\backslash$nhave back arc spreading. This model is applied in detail to the Izu-Bonin-Marianas$\backslash$nsystem. It shows that back arc spreading occurs when the integrated$\backslash$ntension in the upper plate exceeds a value of about 1√{\'{o}}1013 N m‚{\`{a}}{\'{i}}1$\backslash$nand requires a residual tension of about a third that to drive the$\backslash$nback arc spreading once rifting is completed. It shows why the plate$\backslash$ninterface near Guam is seismically coupled, while the plate boundary$\backslash$neverywhere farther north is decoupled. When applied globally, it$\backslash$nsuccessfully predicts the state of seismic coupling and back arc$\backslash$nspreading in more than 80{\%} of the world's subduction zones. Of the$\backslash$nremaining, half can be seen to contain additional complications not$\backslash$nincluded in the model. About 10{\%} of cases remain unexplained, but$\backslash$nsome of these may have incorrectly determined seismic coupling coefficients.},

abstract = {The impact of urbanization on streams is multifold and affects both stream flow and stream-water quality. These impacts can lead to either 1) a decrease in stream base flow via increased runoff to streams and reduced diffuse recharge caused by the burial of soil by impervious cover, or 2) an increase in stream base-flow via addition of anthropogenic water sources. Identifying the sources of inputs to urbanized streams is essential to addressing this issue. In the Austin, Texas area, we find a strong contrast in Sr isotope composition between municipal water and stream water in relatively undeveloped watersheds. Dissolved Sr in stream water from eight watersheds in Austin has a wide range of Sr isotope compositions, from 87Sr/86Sr=0.70778 to 0.70918. The mean 87Sr/86Sr value of stream water in each of the eight watersheds correlates highly to both 1) a variety of indices of the degree of urbanization within the watersheds, such as amount of impervious cover, and 2) mean stream-water concentrations of dissolved ions of anthropogenic origin, such as F, Cl, NO3, Na, and K. These 87Sr/86Sr values can be accounted for by the mixing of two endmembers: 1) the lowest values are similar to those for Cretaceous marine limestones that comprise nearly all of the bedrock in the Austin-area watersheds, and 2) the highest values are similar to Austin municipal water that is taken from the Colorado River of Texas. These relationships enable the novel application of Sr isotopes as a proxy for municipal water contributions to stream base-flow. In the more urbanized watersheds, Sr-isotope mass balance indicates that {\~{}}90{\%} of base flow is composed of water from anthropogenic sources. Sr isotopes may also be applied to identify thresholds in the extent of urbanization, above which stream-water flow and quality is impacted. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Hydrogenous ferromanganese crust deposits on seafloor and volcanic seamounts are archives of past isotopic compositions of the ocean. Isotopic compositions of long-life radiogenic isotopes that are dissolved in the ocean such as Nd and Pb, are mixtures of different erosion products (continents, volcanics arcs, ridges etc...) transported by oceanic currents or winds. Isotopic studies on Mn crusts are thus potential paleogeographic and paleoceanographic tracers. However, global paleogeography can drastically evolve over the period of growth of crust, as well as the latitude, longitude and water depth of the Mn crust. Thus each crust sampled a succession of geographic sites related to its spatial evolution through time. For this reason, valid information about the past ocean isotopic composition can only be extracted from Mn crust under the condition that the successive paleogeographic and paleodepth positions can be reconstructed for each Mn crust. We followed this approach for six hydrogenous Mn crusts from the Pacific Ocean that have recorded Pb and Nd isotopic signals for the past 80 Myr. The evolution of the isotopic data was considered within a proper geodynamical framework that takes into account the paleopositions of the Pacific plate and surrounding continents, of the hot spots and ridges as well as the paths of the six crusts. The differences and similarities between the Pb and Nd revealed by our analysis emphasize their complementarity as paleoceanographic tracers. The Nd isotopes are strongly influenced by the exchange between Indian and Pacific waters, specifically by the progressive closure of the Indonesian Gateway. The closed central Pacific characteristics are defined from the extrapolation of the isotopic trend. This highlights the important role played by erosion of volcanic arcs in the Nd isotopic value of seawater. Our approach also stresses the influence of local volcanic activity (ridges or active hot spot) for lead isotopes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent reports show growing reserves of unconventional gas are available and that there is an appetite from policy makers, industry, and others to better understand the GHG impact of exploiting reserves such as shale gas. There is little publicly available data comparing unconventional and conventional gas production. Existing studies rely on national inventories, but it is not generally possible to separate emissions from unconventional and conventional sources within these totals. Even if unconventional and conventional sites had been listed separately, it would not be possible to eliminate site-specific factors to compare gas production methods on an equal footing. To address this difficulty, the emissions of gas production have instead been modeled. In this way, parameters common to both methods of production can be held constant, while allowing those parameters which differentiate unconventional gas and conventional gas production to vary. The results are placed into the context of power generation, to give a ″well-to-wire″ (WtW) intensity. It was estimated that shale gas typically has a WtW emissions intensity about 1.8-2.4{\%} higher than conventional gas, arising mainly from higher methane releases in well completion. Even using extreme assumptions, it was found that WtW emissions from shale gas need be no more than 15{\%} higher than conventional gas if flaring or recovery measures are used. In all cases considered, the WtW emissions of shale gas powergen are significantly lower than those of coal.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the economic importance of bacterial methane is still a matter of discussion, linked to the evolution of the geochemical understanding. Methane occurrence or accumulations with light isotopic ratios, both for carbon and hydrogen, were thought in earlier days to be primarily due to migration. Then, from several works presented in the eighties, it was claimed that (a) bacterial methane had the same light isotopic signatures as those found in some gas accumulations, mainly at shallow depths, where bacterial activity is possible, and that (b) migration could not induce measurable isotopic fractionation. This gave a non ambiguous origin (bacterial occurrence) for any gas having 12C-enriched methane. Looking back at the experimental and physical evidence of this last assessment, and taking into account the consequences of some new series of gas migration experiments, we now consider that both explanations for isotopically light methane (bacterial generation or migration fractionation) are realistic. Using a simple diagram (ethane over methane versus the carbon isotopic ratio of methane), and modelling the two discussed processes (mixing of bacterial and thermal gas, or diffusion of thermal gases), it is possible in several cases to decipher the origin of the gas series. It would appear for example that Italian gases correspond grossly to a simple mixture between bacterial and thermogenic gases, whereas other gases of various origins (head space gases, gases from German coals, shallow gas pockets in recent sediments, Mexican deep overmature gases) show a trend that we interpret as a result of diffusive fractionation.},

abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional tidal current model is developed and applied to the East China Sea (ECS), the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea. The model well reproduces the major four tides, namely M2, S2, K1 and O1 tides, and their currents. The horizontal distributions of the major four tidal currents are the same as those calculated by the horizontal two-dimensional models. With its high resolutions in the horizontal (12.5 km) and the vertical (20 layers), the model is used to investigate the vertical distributions of tidal current. Four vertical eddy viscosity models are used in the numerical experiments. As the tidal current becomes strong, its vertical shear becomes large and its vertical profile becomes sensitive to the vertical eddy viscosity. As a conclusion, the HU (a) model (Davieset al., 1997), which relates the vertical eddy viscosity to the water depth and depth mean velocity, gives the closest results to the observed data. The reproduction of the amphidromic point of M2 tide in Liaodong Bay is discussed and it is concluded that it depends on the bottom friction stress. The model reproduces a unique vertical profile of tidal current in the Yellow Sea, which is also found in the observed data. The reason for the reproduction of such a unique profile in the model is investigated.},

Thick sediment accumulation (exceeding 5 mm/yr) occurs in the Gulf of Bohai and around the Shandong Peninsula (about two thirds of the total Huanghe River discharge). The old Huanghe Delta suffers from reworking by strong tides and waves and forms a mud patch southwest of Cheju Island (accumulation rate, 2 × 107 t/yr).

Turbid water plumes occur nearshore throughout the year, and their suspended sediments are transported along the tip of the peninsula to the western coastal embayments in the South Sea. The Nakdong River (discharge of 1 × 107 t/yr) is responsible for the eastern nearshore mud of the South Sea.

The semi-diurnal tidal current near the mouth of the Changjiang transports water southward at maximum ebb and northward following maximum flood. Because the tides rotate clockwise, southward flow is followed by shoreward flow, confining the initial river plume and sediment deposition to the coastal region south of the river mouth. Six hours later the remnants of the initial plume move to the north and seaward. The southward discharge on ebb results in initial and greatest sedimentation rates on the south sides of the river mouths. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Modern (last 100 yr) accumulation rates of shelf mud deposits in the Yellow and East China Seas were investigated using the distribution of excess 210Pb (210Pbex) in sediment core samples. Compilation and merger of new and previously published data helped clarify sediment accumulation in these seas. The estimated accumulation rates, together with data of suspended sediment concentrations, provided findings on the sediment budget, origin, and transport pathway of the mud deposits. The overall accumulation distribution in the Yellow and East China Sea shelf revealed a general, cross-shelf decreasing trend along the sediment dispersal system away from the rivers, except for the South Sea (SSM) and southeastern Yellow Sea (SEYSM) mud patches found along the Korean coast. Notably, 210Pbex activity profiles within the SSM and the SEYSM yielded a relatively high accumulation rate of 2-5 mm/yr, implying a sedimentation rate of 4-15 ?? 107 tons per year in this coastal zone. Such an annual accumulation rate is about one order of magnitude greater than the total sediment discharge (6-20 ?? 106 tons/yr) from Korean rivers, suggesting an additional offshore source. The distribution pattern of the well-defined suspended plume clearly showed the possible transport and exchange of fine-grained sediments between the ECS shelf and the coastal area of Korea, especially during winter. Such a high accumulation in Korean coastal areas is attributable to the sediments supplied from the mud deposit of the ECS (i.e., SWCIM), with origins in Chinese rivers. Therefore, the Korean coastal area may be an important sink for some of Chinese river sediments being transported from the south by the Yellow Sea Warm Current. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Today, Asian rivers play an important role in delivering sediment from the land to the oceans. However, past sediment discharge before human activities modified the landscape is not well known and is estimated to have been roughly one-third to one-half of the present level. Chinese rivers have been strongly influenced by human activities, and their sediment discharge has changed over the last 6000 years. For the study of the long-term human impact on rivers and catchment basins, Chinese rivers provide excellent examples because continuous historical records are available. Here, the characteristics, evolution and sediment discharge during the Holocene of the deltas of two large Chinese rivers, Huanghe (Yellow River) and Changjiang (Yangtze River) are summarized. The Huanghe and Changjiang deltas are different with respect to coastal environments, water and sediment discharge, the pattern of development of the delta lobe, thickness of Holocene sediments, and basal topography of the incised valleys formed during the last glacial period. The Huanghe Delta is characterized by a high concentration of sediment, huge sediment discharge, thin Holocene deltaic sediments, a lateral delta lobe shift, and a steep longitudinal profile in its lower reaches. The Changjiang Delta is characterized by a large water discharge, a large interseasonal water-level change, a tide-dominated coastal environment, continuous seaward progradation with isolated river-mouth sand bodies, thick Holocene sediments, and a deep-incised valley formed during the last glacial period. Based on the sediment volume of prograding deltaic sediments over the last 6000 years, the sediment discharge of Huanghe 1000 years ago is estimated to have been 1 × 108 tons/year, 1/10 of the present level. An abrupt increase occurred at ca. 1000 years ago as a consequence of human activities on the Loess Plateau, especially involving cultivation and deforestation. Moreover, the estimated sediment load of Huanghe at Sanmenxia station prior to 1000 years was 2.7-4.0 × 108 tons/year, or about 20{\%} (15-25{\%}) of the present level. Our recent study estimated that the sediment discharge of Changjiang before 2000 years BP was ca. 2.4 × 108 tons/year. Total sediment discharge of both rivers before 2000 years BP is estimated to have been 3.4 × 108 tons/year, or only about 20{\%} of the present level. Moreover, the total sediment load to the lower reaches is estimated to have been 5-6 × 108 tons/year, or one-fourth the present level. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The debate surrounding the safety of shale gas development in the Appalachian Basin has generated increased awareness of drinking water quality in rural communities. Concerns include the potential for migration of stray gas, metal-rich formation brines, and hydraulic fracturing and/or flowback fluids to drinking water aquifers. A critical question common to these environmental risks is the hydraulic connectivity between the shale gas formations and the overlying shallow drinking water aquifers. We present geochemical evidence from northeastern Pennsylvania showing that pathways, unrelated to recent drilling activities, exist in some locations between deep underlying formations and shallow drinking water aquifers. Integration of chemical data (Br, Cl, Na, Ba, Sr, and Li) and isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 2H/H, 18O/16O, and 228Ra/226Ra) from this and previous studies in 426 shallow groundwater samples and 83 northern Appalachian brine samples suggest that mixing relationships between shallow ground water and a deep formation brine causes groundwater salinization in some locations. The strong geochemical fingerprint in the salinized (Cl {\textgreater} 20 mg/L) groundwater sampled from the Alluvium, Catskill, and Lock Haven aquifers suggests possible migration of Marcellus brine through naturally occurring pathways. The occurrences of saline water do not correlate with the location of shale-gas wells and are consistent with reported data before rapid shale-gas development in the region; however, the presence of these fluids suggests conductive pathways and specific geostructural and/or hydrodynamic regimes in northeastern Pennsylvania that are at increased risk for contamination of shallow drinking water resources, particularly by fugitive gases, because of natural hydraulic connections to deeper formations.},

abstract = {Silurian and Devonian natural gas reservoirs present within New York state represent an example of unconventional gas accumulations within the northern Appalachian Basin. These unconventional energy resources, previously thought to be noneconomically viable, have come into play following advances in drilling (i.e., horizontal drilling) and extraction (i.e., hydraulic fracturing) capabilities. Therefore, efforts to understand these and other domestic and global natural gas reserves have recently increased. The suspicion of fugitive mass migration issues within current Appalachian production fields has catalyzed the need to develop a greater understanding of the genetic grouping (source) and migrational history of natural gases in this area. We introduce new noble gas data in the context of published hydrocarbon carbon (C1,C2+) ($\delta$13C) data to explore the genesis of thermogenic gases in the Appalachian Basin. This study includes natural gases from two distinct genetic groups: group 1, Upper Devonian (Marcellus shale and Canadaway Group) gases generated in situ, characterized by early mature ($\Delta$13C[C1 − C2][$\delta$13C1 − $\delta$13C2]: {\textless}–9‰), isotopically light methane, with low (4He) (average, 1 × 10−3 cc/cc) elevated 4He/40Ar* and 21Ne*/40Ar* (where the asterisk denotes excess radiogenic or nucleogenic production beyond the atmospheric ratio), and a variable, atmospherically (air-saturated–water) derived noble gas component; and group 2, a migratory natural gas that emanated from Lower Ordovician source rocks (i.e., most likely, Middle Ordovician Trenton or Black River group) that is currently hosted primarily in Lower Silurian sands (i.e., Medina or Clinton group) characterized by isotopically heavy, mature methane ($\Delta$13C[C1 – C2] [$\delta$13C1 − $\delta$13C2]: {\textgreater}3‰), with high (4He) (average, 1.85 × 10−3 cc/cc) 4He/40Ar* and 21Ne*/40Ar* near crustal production levels and elevated crustal noble gas content (enriched 4He, 21Ne*, 40Ar*). Because the release of each crustal noble gas (i.e., He, Ne, Ar) from mineral grains in the shale matrix is regulated by temperature, natural gases obtain and retain a record of the thermal conditions of the source rock. Therefore, noble gases constitute a valuable technique for distinguishing the genetic source and post-genetic processes of natural gases.},

abstract = {The ability to identify a formation mechanism for natural gas in a particular environment requires consideration of several geochemical factors when there are multiple sources present. Four primary sources of methane have been identified in Mono Lake. Two of these sources were associated with numerous natural gas seeps which occur at various locations in the lake and extend beyond its present boundary; the two other gas sources result from current microbiological processes. In the natural gas seeps, we observed flow rates as high as 160 moles CH4 day-1, and estimate total lakewide annual seep flux to be 2.1 106 moles CH4. Geochemical parameters C3H8) anddelta14CH4measurements revealed that most of the seeps originate from a paleo-biogenic (delta13CH4 = about -70{\%}.). natural gas deposit of Pleistocene age which underlies the current and former lakebed. Gas seeps in the vicinity of hot springs had, in combination with the biogenic gas, a prominent thermogenic gas component resulting from hydrothermal alteration of buried organic matter. Current microbiological processes responsible for sources of natural gas in the lake included pelagic meth- anogenesis and decomposition of terrestrial grasses in the littoral zone. Methanogenesis in the pelagic sediments resulted in methane saturation (2-3 mM at 50 cm; delta13CH4 = about -85{\%}.). Interstitial sulfate decreased from 133 mM at the surface to 35 mM by 110 cm depth, indicating that sulfate-reduction and methanogenesis operated concurrently. Methane diffused out of the sediments resulting in concentrations of about 50 muM in the anoxic bottom waters. Methane oxidation in the oxic/anoxic boundry lowered the concentration by {\textgreater}98{\%}, but values in surface waters (0.1-1.3muM) were supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. The delta13CH4 (range = -21.8 to -71.8{\%}.) of this unoxidized residual methane was enriched in 13C relative to methane in the bottom water and sediments. Average outward flux of this methane was 2.77 107 moles yr-1. A fourth, but minor source of methane (delta13CH4 = -55.2{\%}.) was associated with the decomposition of terrestrial grasses taking place in the lake's recently expanded littoral zone.},

abstract = {Several hundred samples of carbon from various geologic sources have been analyzed in a new survey of the variation of the ratio C13/C12 in nature. Mass spectrometric determinations were made on the instruments developed by H. C. Urey and his co-workers utilizing two complete feed systems with magnetic switching to determine small differences in isotope ratios between samples and a standard gas. With this procedure variations of the ratio C13/C12 can be determined with an accuracy of ±0.01{\%} of the ratio. The results confirm previous work with a few exceptions. The range of variation in the ratio is 4.5{\%}. Terrestrial organic carbon and carbonate rocks constitute two well defined groups, the carbonates being richer in C13 by some 2{\%}. Marine organic carbon lies in a range intermediate between these groups. Atmospheric CO2 is richer in C13 than was formerly believed. Fossil wood, coal and limestones show no correlation of C13/C12 ratio with age. If petroleum is of marine organic origin a considerable change in isotopic composition has probably occurred. Such a change seems to have occurred in carbon from black shales and carbonaceous schists. Samples of graphites, diamonds, igneous rocks and gases from Yellowstone Park have been analyzed. The origin of graphite cannot be determined from C13/C12 ratios. The terrestrial distribution of carbon isotopes between igneous rocks and sediments is discussed with reference to the available meteoritic determinations. Isotopic fractionation between iron carbide and graphite in meteorites may indicate the mechanism by which early fractionation between deep seated and surface terrestrial carbon may have occurred.},

This work presents a practical methodology for the estimation of solute concentration contour maps and volume averages (needed for mass calculations) from data obtained from the analysis of water and soil samples. The methodology, which is an extension of linear geostatistics, produces a point estimate, i.e., a representative value, as well as a confidence interval, which contains the true value with a given probability. The approach uses a parsimonious model that accounts for the skewness by adding only one parameter to those used in linear geostatistics (variograms or generalized covariances). The resulting nonlinear kriging method is not substantially more difficult to use than linear geostatistics. The methodology is most appropriate when concentration measurements are available on a reasonably dense grid and no additional information (based on modeling flow and transport) can be used. We present and illustrate through an application, a practical approach to estimate all the parameters needed and to select and test the model. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We adopt both 2-D and 3-D shape functions from finite element methods for the spatio-temporal interpolation of 2-D spatial and 1-D temporal data sets. We also develop new 4-D shape functions and use them for the spatio-temporal interpolation of 3-D spatial and 1-D temporal data sets. Using an actual real estate data set with house prices, we compare these methods with other spatio-temporal interpolation methods based on inverse distance weighting and kriging. The comparison criteria include interpolation accuracy, error-proneness to time aggregation, invariance to scaling on the coordinate axes, and the type of constraints used in the representation of the interpolated data. Our experimental results show that the extension method based on shape functions is the most accurate and the overall best spatio-temporal interpolation method. New color rendering algorithms are also developed for the visualization of time slices of the interpolated spatio-temporal data. We show some visualization results of the real estate data set including the vertical profile of house prices. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Its general idea is based on the assumption that the attribute value of an unsampled point is the weighted average of known values within the neighborhood, and the weights are inversely related to the distances between the prediction location and the sampled locations. The inverse-distance weight is modified by a constant power or a distance-decay parameter to adjust the diminishing strength in relationship with increasing distance. Recognizing the potential of varying distance-decay relationships over the study area, we suggest that the value of the weighting parameter be allowed to vary according to the spatial pattern of the sampled points in the neighborhood. This adaptive approach suggests that the distance-decay parameter can be a function of the point pattern of the neighborhood. We developed an algorithm to search for "optimal" adaptive distance-decay parameters. Using cross validation to evaluate the results, we conclude that adaptive IDW performs better than the constant parameter method in most cases, and better than ordinary kriging in one of our empirical studies when the spatial structure in the data could not be modeled effectively by typical variogram functions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Spatial interpolation methods have been applied to many disciplines. Many factors affect the performance of the methods, but there are no consistent findings about their effects. In this study, we use comparative studies in environmental sciences to assess the performance and to quantify the impacts of data properties on the performance. Two new measures are proposed to compare the performance of the methods applied to variables with different units/scales. A total of 53 comparative studies were assessed and the performance of 72 methods/sub-methods compared is analysed. The impacts of sample density, data variation and sampling design on the estimations of 32 methods are quantified using data derived from their application to 80 variables. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), and ordinary co-kriging (OCK) are the most frequently used methods. Data variation is a dominant impact factor and has significant effects on the performance of the methods. As the variation increases, the accuracy of all methods decreases and the magnitude of decrease is method dependent. Irregular-spaced sampling design might improve the accuracy of estimation. The effect of sampling density on the performance of the methods is found not to be significant. The implications of these findings are discussed. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Accurate methods quantifying whole landfill surface flux of methane are important for regulatory and research purposes. This paper presents the results from the analysis of chamber measurements utilizing geospatial techniques [kriging and inverse distance weighting (IDW)] to arrive at an estimation of the whole landfill surface flux from the spatially distributed chamber measurement points. The difficulties in utilizing these methods will be discussed. Methane flux was determined on approximately 20 m grid spacing and variogram analysis was performed in order to model spatial structure, which was used to estimate methane flux at unsampled locations through kriging. Our analysis indicates that while the semi-variogram model showed some spatial structure, IDW was a more accurate interpolation method for this particular site. This was seen in the comparison of the resulting contour maps. IDW, coupled with surface area algorithms to extract the total area of user defined contour intervals, provides a superior estimate of the methane flux as confirmed through the methane balance. It is critical that the results of the emissions estimates be viewed in light of the whole cell methane balance; otherwise, there is no rational check and balance system to validate the results. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the gas flow in microgeometries was investigated using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. New treatments for boundary conditions are verified by simulations of micro-Poiseuille flow, compared with the previous boundary treatments, and slip analytical solutions of the continuum theory. The orifice flow and the corner flow in microchannels are simulated using the modified DSMC codes. The predictions were compared with existing experimental phenomena as well as predictions using continuum theory. The results showed that the channel geometry significantly affects the microgas flow. In the orifice flow, the flow separation occurred at very small Reynolds numbers. In the corner flow, no flow separation occurred even with a high driving pressure.

abstract = {An isotopic model to predict delta(13)C values for methane (C-1), ethane (C-2), and propane (C-3) as a function of fractional conversion of kerogen and/or oil to gas is proposed for gas generation from Type II kerogen. Fractional conversion is then correlated to gas generation temperature by coupling the isotopic model to a multicomponent compositional kinetic model for gas generation. The relationships between delta(13)C(1), delta(13)C(2) and delta(13)C(3) are constrained by the natural gas plot model of thermal cracking. The isotopic model has been tested and calibrated using a data set of gas samples derived from sapropelic marine shales (Type II kerogen) in the Delaware and Val Verde basins, West Texas. These gases are relatively unaffected by migration or mixing of biogenic gas, so that changes in carbon isotope ratios of the gas components primarily reflect the effect of maturation. This data set is therefore useful for illustrating the relationship between gas generation temperature and delta(13)C values for gases derived from Type II kerogen. Several applications of the isotopic/compositional kinetic model in petroleum system evaluation are discussed. The effect of burial history on the relationship between delta(13)C(1) delta(13)C3(,) and gas generation temperature can be determined from the coupled models. Also, delta(13)C values of C-1-C-3 observed in the reservoir will depend on whether gas accumulates from source to trap, or whether it is expelled at various stages into several traps. Both trapping scenarios can be examined using the isotopic/compositional kinetic model. Separate isotopic models are needed for gases derived from Type II versus Type III kerogens because of the larger difference between delta(13)C(1) and delta(13)C(2) observed for gases generated from terrestrial organic matter. This larger difference may result from greater molecular or isotopic heterogeneity in Type III kerogens, or may reflect differences in generation and/or accumulation of gases from the differing kerogen types.},

abstract = {Biodegradation of crude oil in subsurface petroleum reservoirs has adversely affected the majority of the world's oil, making recovery and refining of that oil more costly. The prevalent occurrence of biodegradation in shallow subsurface petroleum reservoirs has been attributed to aerobic bacterial hydrocarbon degradation stimulated by surface recharge of oxygen-bearing meteoric waters. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the likelihood of encountering biodegraded oils at higher levels of degradation in reservoirs near the surface. More recent findings, however, suggest that anaerobic degradation processes dominate subsurface sedimentary environments, despite slow reaction kinetics and uncertainty as to the actual degradation pathways occurring in oil reservoirs. Here we use laboratory experiments in microcosms monitoring the hydrocarbon composition of degraded oils and generated gases, together with the carbon isotopic compositions of gas and oil samples taken at wellheads and a Rayleigh isotope fractionation box model, to elucidate the probable mechanisms of hydrocarbon degradation in reservoirs. We find that crude-oil hydrocarbon degradation under methanogenic conditions in the laboratory mimics the characteristic sequential removal of compound classes seen in reservoir-degraded petroleum. The initial preferential removal of n-alkanes generates close to stoichiometric amounts of methane, principally by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Our data imply a common methanogenic biodegradation mechanism in subsurface degraded oil reservoirs, resulting in consistent patterns of hydrocarbon alteration, and the common association of dry gas with severely degraded oils observed worldwide. Energy recovery from oilfields in the form of methane, based on accelerating natural methanogenic biodegradation, may offer a route to economic production of difficult-to-recover energy from oilfields.},

abstract = {Shengli oil field, the second largest oil and gas field in China, is located in the Tertiary Dongying graben system in the southern Bohai Basin. Three petroleum systems, one for each mapped source rock, and as many as seven reservoir rocks are documented in the Dongying graben system, representing a complex migration and accumulation pattern. In addition, both the source and the reservoir facies are distributed unevenly throughout the system, requiring a complex distribution of possible migration pathways. Stratigraphic conduits, that is, sandy and conglomeratic facies, are mostly present in the northern graben flank area, where coarse sediments provide possible migration pathways. Over most of the basin, however, faults—active at different times throughout basin evolution—add important additional conduits for petroleum migration, as well as acting locally as seals, depending on their surrounding lithology and their respective sealing or leaking properties through time. This article aims to show that the Shengli oil field provides an excellent example of how threedimensional petroleum systems modeling allows the assessment of fault behavior and timing to predict the distribution of hydrocarbons in a system.},

abstract = {Clumped isotopes analyses in modern land snail shells are reported and used to interpret shell oxygen isotopes within the context of terrestrial paleo-climatology. Carbonate clumped isotopes thermometry is a new technique for estimating the temperature of formation of carbonate minerals. It is most powerful as an indicator of environmental parameters in combination with $\delta$18O, allowing the partitioning of the $\delta$18O signal into its temperature and water components. Results indicate that snail shell calcification temperatures are typically higher than either the mean annual or the snail activity season ambient temperatures. Small inter- and intra-snail variability suggests that shell aragonite forms at isotopic equilibrium so that the derived temperatures are an eco-physiological parameter reflecting snail body temperature at the time of calcification. We attribute these higher body temperatures to snail eco-physiological adaptations through shell color, morphology, and behavior. In combination with shell oxygen isotope composition, these temperatures allow us to calculate snail body water composition, which is in turn interpreted as a paleo-hydrological indicator, reflecting isotopic composition of local precipitation modified by local evaporation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many important hominid-bearing fossil localities in East Africa are in regions that are extremely hot and dry. Although humans are well adapted to such conditions, it has been inferred that East African environments were cooler or more wooded during the Pliocene and Pleistocene when this region was a central stage of human evolution. Here we show that the Turkana Basin, Kenya--today one of the hottest places on Earth--has been continually hot during the past 4 million years. The distribution of (13)C-(18)O bonds in paleosol carbonates indicates that soil temperatures during periods of carbonate formation were typically above 30 degrees C and often in excess of 35 degrees C. Similar soil temperatures are observed today in the Turkana Basin and reflect high air temperatures combined with solar heating of the soil surface. These results are specific to periods of soil carbonate formation, and we suggest that such periods composed a large fraction of integrated time in the Turkana Basin. If correct, this interpretation has implications for human thermophysiology and implies a long-standing human association with marginal environments.},

abstract = {The seepage of methane through the seabed of the world's continental shelves is considered. Methane may be generated by both bacterial and thermogenic processes acting on the complex organic matter stored in the seabed. Because these processes are ubiquitous, occurrences of gas and gas seepages are probably widespread. Although numerous observations of methane seepages from shallow marine sources have been reported, there are few documented flux measurements. Whereas a prolific 400 g CH4 m-2 year-1 has been calculated for an 18 km2 area in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, a more modest 26 g CH4 m-2 year-1 has been estimated for a site in the North Sea. Descriptions of these and other areas of gas seepage, from a variety of geological and oceanographic environments, are presented. A rough estimation of the global flux suggests that between 8 and 65 Tg of methane passes through the seabed of the continental shelves annually. If a significant proportion of this passes through the water column and into the atmosphere, the oceans may represent a more significant source of methane than has been suggested previously. As much of this methane is C-14-depleted, it may at least partially account for the shortfall of fossil methane in current atmospheric methane budgets.},

abstract = {The latest Permian was a time of major change in ocean chemistry, accompanying the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic. To examine the nature of these changes, samples from two well-studied marine sections that span the Permian-Triassic boundary have been analyzed: the Meishan and Shangsi sections located in Southern China. Isotopic analysis of the carbonate-associated sulfate in these samples provides a detailed record of several isotopic shifts in [delta]34SCAS approaching and across the PTB, ranging from +30 to -15[per mille sign] (VCDT), with repeated asynchronous fluctuations at the two locations. We interpret the patterns of isotopic shifts, in conjunction with other data, to indicate a shallow unstable chemocline overlying euxinic deep-water which periodically upwelled into the photic zone. These chemocline upward excursion events introduced sulfide to the photic zone stimulating a bloom of phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria. We hypothesize that elemental sulfur globules produced by these organisms and 34S-depleted pyrite produced in the euxinic water column were deposited in the sediment; later oxidation led to incorporation as CAS. This created the large changes to the [delta]34SCAS observed in the latest Permian at these locations.},

abstract = {Sulfur and strontium isotopes ($\delta$34S and 87Sr/86Sr) were determined in 39 river water samples collected over three different cultivation periods (April, May, and June), and in several materials used for comparison (fertilizers, detergents, soils, irrigation and agricultural waters), to evaluate the impact of fertilizers on a small agricultural watershed of Lake Biwa, in central Japan. $\delta$34S values in river water decreased (from + 5.8 to - 2.0‰) with increasing SO4 concentrations (3.8 to 93.2 ppm) from upstream to downstream of the watershed. Comparison of river water S isotopes with those of possible source materials indicates that the enrichment of SO4 can be attributed to the dissolution of two kinds of fertilizers: (1) compound fertilizers commonly used in this area and (2) ammonium sulfate which is applied on a small scale. In contrast, 87Sr/86Sr values of river water decreased with time from April (avg. 0.71163), through May (avg. 0.71139), to June (avg. 0.71127). The tendency of the sample plots on the 87Sr/86Sr vs. 1/Sr diagram suggests a time-dependent increase in the contribution of soil water to the river, which is partly affected by the Sr-bearing fertilizers. It is suggested that a maximum of 25{\%} of dissolved Sr is derived from these fertilizers, while more than 75{\%} of it is of rock origin. Mass balance calculations permitted us to evaluate the proportion of fertilizer contribution in each river. Combined use of S and Sr isotopes together with concentration data could be a new environmental diagnosis technique for rivers and soils in localized watersheds. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Extraction of natural gas from shale rock in the United States (US) is one of the landmark events in the 21st century. The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing can extract huge quantities of natural gas from impermeable shale formations, which were previously thought to be either impossible or uneconomic to produce. This review offers a comprehensive insight into US shale gas opportunities, appraising the evolution, evidence and the challenges of shale gas production in the US. The history of US shale gas in this article is divided into three periods and based on the change of oil price (i.e., the period before the 1970s oil crisis, the period from 1970s to 2000, and the period since 2000), the US has moved from being one of the world's biggest importers of gas to being self-sufficient in less than a decade, with the shale gas production increasing 12-fold (from 2000 to 2010). The US domestic natural gas price hit a 10-year low in 2012. The US domestic natural gas price in the first half of 2012 was about {\$}2 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU), compared with Brent crude, the world benchmark price for oil, now about {\$} 80-100/barrel, or {\$}14-17 per million BTU. Partly due to an increase in gas-fired power generation in response to low gas prices, US carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion fell by 430 million ton CO2 - more than any other country - between 2006 and 2011. Shale gas also stimulated economic growth, creating 600,000 new jobs in the US by 2010. However, the US shale gas revolution would be curbed, if the environmental risks posed by hydraulic fracturing are not managed effectively. The hydraulic fracturing is water intensive, and can cause pollution in the marine environment, with implications for long-term environmental sustainability in several ways. Also, large amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, can be emitted during the shale gas exploration and production. Hydraulic fracturing also may induce earthquakes. These environmental risks need to be managed by good practices which is not being applied by all the producers in all the locations. Enforcing stronger regulations are necessary to minimize risk to the environment and on human health. Robust regulatory oversight can however increase the cost of extraction, but stringent regulations can foster an historic opportunity to provide cheaper and cleaner gas to meet the consumer demand, as well as to usher in the future growth of the industry. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Nevertheless, determining rates and controls of BNF is crucial to placing anthropogenic changes to the N cycle in context, and to understanding, predicting and managing many aspects of global environmental change. Here, we estimate terrestrial BNF for a pre-industrial world by combining information on N fluxes with (15)N relative abundance data for terrestrial ecosystems. Our estimate is that pre-industrial N fixation was 58 (range of 40-100) Tg N fixed yr(-1); adding conservative assumptions for geological N reduces our best estimate to 44 Tg N yr(-1). This approach yields substantially lower estimates than most recent calculations; it suggests that the magnitude of human alternation of the N cycle is substantially larger than has been assumed.},

abstract = {We present a new nitrogen isotope model incorporated into the three‐dimensional ocean component of a global Earth system climate model designed for millennial timescale simulations. The model includes prognostic tracers for the two stable nitrogen isotopes, 14N and 15N, in the nitrate (NO3 −), phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus variables of the marine ecosystem model. The isotope effects of algal NO3 − uptake, nitrogen fixation, water column denitrification, and zooplankton excretion are considered as well as the removal of NO3 − by sedimentary denitrification. A global database of d15NO3 − observations is compiled from previous studies and compared to the model results on a regional basis where sufficient observations exist. The model is able to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce many of the observed patterns such as high subsurface values in water column denitrification zones and the meridional and vertical gradients in the Southern Ocean. The observed pronounced subsurface minimum in the Atlantic is underestimated by the model presumably owing to too little simulated nitrogen fixation there. Sensitivity experiments reveal that algal NO3 − uptake, nitrogen fixation, and water column denitrification have the strongest effects on the simulated distribution of nitrogen isotopes, whereas the effect from zooplankton excretion is weaker. Both water column and sedimentary denitrification also have important indirect effects on the nitrogen isotope distribution by reducing the fixed nitrogen inventory, which creates an ecological niche for nitrogen fixers and, thus, stimulates additional N2 fixation in the model. Important model deficiencies are identified, and strategies for future improvement and possibilities for model application are outlined.},

This paper introduces a new MATLAB script developed for visualizing results from scanline surveys as traces in 2D and disks in 3D. The script is also able to cluster orientation data and to present statistical summaries and to reflect the change in degree of rock brokenness along the scanline. Advantages of this new script are that it can present undulating discontinuities as wavy surfaces and different discontinuity properties using color codes. An intensity rose diagram is utilized to visualize interdependency of certain properties and orientation. This new script has a potential for preprocessing vast amounts of scanline and oriented drill core logging data before using it in 3D discontinuity network modeling. The script is demonstrated using data concerning rock fracturing gathered from a dimension stone quarry in Southern Finland. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The analysis of delta(13)C and delta(18)O in tree-ring archives offers retrospective insights into environmental conditions and ecophysiological processes. While photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination and evaporative oxygen isotope enrichment are well understood, we lack information on how the isotope signal is altered by downstream metabolic processes. In Pinus sylvestris, we traced the isotopic signals from their origin in the leaf water (delta(18)O) or the newly assimilated carbon (delta(13)C), via phloem sugars to the tree-ring, over a time-scale that ranges from hours to a growing season. Seasonally, variable (13)C enrichment of sugars related to phloem loading and transport did lead to uncoupling between delta(13)C in the tree-ring, and the c(i)/c(a) ratio at the leaf level. In contrast, the oxygen isotope signal was transferred from the leaf water to the tree-ring with an expected enrichment of 27 per thousand, with time-lags of approximately 2 weeks and with a 40{\%} exchange between organic oxygen and xylem water oxygen during cellulose synthesis. This integrated overview of the fate of carbon and oxygen isotope signals within the model tree species P. sylvestris provides a novel physiological basis for the interpretation of delta(13)C and delta(18)O in tree-ring ecology.},

abstract = {Rapid population growth in the intermontane, semi-arid, Okanagan Valley of Western Canada has led to water shortages with increasing debate over competing water interests. Nevertheless, the relationships between the various water resources of the Okanagan remain poorly defined. Stable isotopes of hydrogen (??2H) and oxygen (??18O) were used to assess rainfall importance and the sources and flux of water to and from rivers and lakes in watersheds, and to evaluate the origin of ground water resources. Precipitation isotopes resulted in a meteoric water line of ??2H=6.6 (??18O)-22.7 for the Okanagan Valley. Isotopic seasonality in precipitation was evident, with summer precipitation clearly affected by local recycling of water vapor. The 2H and 18O of surface waters were more positive than mean annual precipitation, indicative of basin-scale evaporation of surface waters; however, Okanagan Lake and its downstream river and lake system were isotopically synchronous, indicating that they behaved as a single well-mixed hydrologic unit. Isotopic mass-balance modeling revealed ???35{\%} of inflow to the Lake Okanagan watershed was lost to evaporation, validating a meteorological water balance model for the region. Highland bedrock was recharged with snow-melt and early spring rains, with the isotopic composition dependent on elevation. Ground waters in the Valley bottom aquifers west of Osoyoos were recharged by irrigation water obtained from the Okanagan River system, with no evidence of recharge connections from the highland bedrock. ?? 2011 .},

abstract = {Renewable fresh water over continents has input from precipitation and losses to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. Global-scale estimates of transpiration from climate models are poorly constrained owing to large uncertainties in stomatal conductance and the lack of catchment-scale measurements required for model calibration, resulting in a range of predictions spanning 20 to 65 per cent of total terrestrial evapotranspiration (14,000 to 41,000 km(3) per year) (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Here we use the distinct isotope effects of transpiration and evaporation to show that transpiration is by far the largest water flux from Earth's continents, representing 80 to 90 per cent of terrestrial evapotranspiration. On the basis of our analysis of a global data set of large lakes and rivers, we conclude that transpiration recycles 62,000 ± 8,000 km(3) of water per year to the atmosphere, using half of all solar energy absorbed by land surfaces in the process. We also calculate CO2 uptake by terrestrial vegetation by connecting transpiration losses to carbon assimilation using water-use efficiency ratios of plants, and show the global gross primary productivity to be 129 ± 32 gigatonnes of carbon per year, which agrees, within the uncertainty, with previous estimates. The dominance of transpiration water fluxes in continental evapotranspiration suggests that, from the point of view of water resource forecasting, climate model development should prioritize improvements in simulations of biological fluxes rather than physical (evaporation) fluxes.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH4 L-1 (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L-1 (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$13C-CH4 values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$13C-CH4 data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$2H-CH4 values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and—possibly—regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

annote = {General Objective: Illustrate to the reader how far geomorpholog, sediment geology, geophysics, and other geological disciplines have come in making links between tectonic processes, landscape evolution, and climate change. Plainly speaking, Whittaker sought to review the progress that geoscientists have made in using topography as a signal for tectonics and climate flucctuations. 




My general sentiments: In reading this paper, I felt Whittaker did a good job of elucidating the two different drivers of interest 1) tectonics and 2) climate. However, I did think he did not spend that much time on the climatic argument. Nevertheless I found this piece useful in increasing my knowledge about the relationship between tectonics and climate as well as how topography could be used to express that relationship. 




-----


What I have found frustrating with reading some geomorphological studies is how they attempt to create these quantitative "laws" in a highly variable environment. However, to his credit, Whitaker acknolwedges that qualitative results are still the general product of geomorphic studies. The stream power erosion law is interesting. I feel that using the normalized steppness index is an example of an unsuccessful attempt to relate a physical phenomenon to a mathematical expression. As Whittaker mentions there are several locations with the same or similar steepness index values but with different uplift rates. Furthermore, the use of knickpoints seems almost even more challenging to use without great knowledge of the sedimentology of the area. If the sediment transport and erosional properties of the fluvial system are not well understood, I believe it would be highly irresponsible to use knickpoints for studying the link between tectonics and topography. However, with an apporpriate level of understanding of the history of the fluvial system, the migration of knickpoints can be useful in resolving some of the discrepencies of using just the steepness index.


Climate from topography is perhaps even more difficult to glean useful information. Yes, Whitaker makes a good point in describing how discharge rates can be tied to erosinal rates, which would be related to steepness indicies. From reading this paper, I would answer Whitaker's question about finding the relationship between climate and topography over geological timescales to be extremely difficult and probably unknowable. Unless, through the work of atmospheric and isotopic hydrological science (I would imagine the answer would come from here) that longer timescale measurements of precipitation could help unveil this relationship.},

My sentiments: One think I like about this study is that it is not assessment of the climatic history of a certain region. This would lead to difficulties in applying Whipple{\&}{\#}039;s ideas at longer timescales. By keeping this study mainly a mechanistic analysis of climate and tectonics it will set the grounndwork for others who can create a strong climatic record to make inferences on the relationship between climate and tectonics.

I like the starting point of this study, tying the erosion of the orogenic (or accretionary) wedge to deformational and tectonic dynamics. 

        
Critical-Taper Therory: the geophysical expression that shows that an orogenic wedge will advance across the subducting plate as opposed to deforming internally within the wedge. From this definition it would follow that climatic factors could affect the tectonic processes occuring at a convergent boundary.

        
For the "fixed-width" analyses, Whipple is definitely on what I would say is the right track. I believe he has set up appropiate relationships between erisional and tectonic processes. For instance, relief will be changed due to erionsal affects but not by tectonic processes. 

        
In the friction-dominated mountain belts, I think we see again how difficult it is to tie climatic processes with tectonics. It appears that only through heavy or extreme processes that it is possible to discern the relationship between tectonics and climate through a geological investigation},

This is a highly cited paper. A bit hard to read - lots of organic chemistry. Their Fig. 8 shows what we can do with carbon isotopes of CO2 and CH4, which is what the Picarro G2201-I measures.

However, the paper focuses on pore fluids during diagenesis. The gases released from the Chattanooga Shale, which is late Devonian and therefore {\~{}}370 Ma, formed well after diagenesis. If methane was released during diagenesis then bulk 13C and therefore $\delta$13C of methane would increase. The more refractory carbon would gradually break down, either during thermogenesis (at greater depths and higher tyemperatures) or during exhumation (perhaps bacterial in the form of methyl fermentation?). The Chattanooga Shale is underlain and overlain by limestone, and therefore likely formed in a shallow marine setting, so gases, if diagenetic and retained, may actually plot in the marine carbonate reduction field. 
We could use $\delta$D of CH4 and formation water to differentiate between saline marine and freshwater - see Fig. 10.

It would also be helpful to measure concentrations of C1 (methane), C2 (ethane) and C3 (propane?) using gas chromatography and plot versus $\delta$13C of methane on a "Bernard" diagram - see Fig. 12. Could distinguish between bacterial and thermogenic, and identify oxidation and mixing trends. Does not require hydrogen isotopes.},

Unlike biologists, specifically microbiologists, geologists do not have the luxry of obtaining observations of processes in bulk like in genetics. Our approach has to be deliberate and we have to look at our work as being in the "middle," meaning landscapes have moved before we were born and will continue to move after we expire.




Luckily, the the theory of uniformitarianism helps be confident that the processes we observe during our research careers maintain a form of consistency that enables us to draw conclusions about sediment transport from source to sink.},

abstract = {The static chamber method (non-flow-through-non-steady-state chambers) is the most common method to measure fluxes of methane (CH4) from soils. Laboratory comparisons to quantify errors resulting from chamber design, operation and flux calculation methods are rare. We tested fifteen chambers against four flux levels (FL) ranging from 200 to 2300 ?g CH4m−2 h−1. The measurements were conducted on a calibration tank using three quartz sand types with soil porosities of 53{\%} (dry fine sand, S1), 47{\%} (dry coarse sand, S2), and 33{\%} (wetted fine sand, S3). The chambers tested ranged from 0.06 to 1.8 m in height, and 0.02 to 0.195 m3 in volume, 7 of them were equipped with a fan, and 1 with a vent-tube. We applied linear and exponential flux calculation methods to the chamber data and compared these chamber fluxes to the reference fluxes from the calibration tank. The chambers underestimated the reference fluxes by on average 33{\%} by the linear flux calculation method (Rlin), whereas the chamber fluxes calculated by the exponential flux calculation method (Rexp) did not significantly differ from the reference fluxes (p {\textless} 0.05). The flux under- or overestimations were chamber specific and independent of flux level. Increasing chamber height, area and volume signifi- cantly reduced the flux underestimation (p {\textless} 0.05). Also, the use of non-linear flux calculation method significantly improved the flux estimation; however, simultaneously the uncertainty in the fluxes was increased. We provide correction factors, which can be used to correct the under- or overestimation of the fluxes by the chambers in the experiment.},

annote = {Two mechanisms of forming isotopes:








1) Spontaneous Decay
2) Enrichment or depletion resulting form chemical reactions








Isotones: Have the same number of neutrons but different number of protons








Isobars: Have the same atomic numbers but have different configurations of protons and neutrons








Only 270 stable atoms








Atomic Weight =sum( Mass{\_}Isotope * Abundance {\_}Isotope)








Binding Energy (E{\_}B): Energy that holds the components of the nucleus together. This causes the mass of the atom to be less than what may be calculated from the sum of protons, electrons, and neutrons.E{\_}B = Delta(m) * c{\^{}}2where Delta(m) is the mass defect and c is the speed of light in a vaccum








The unit for E{\_}B is the electron volt (eV). An eV is equivlaent to 1.60210E-12 erg. 








1 amu = (1/A) * gram , where A is Avogodro's number








1 amu = 931.5 MeV. This can be substituted into an earlier equation to express the binding energy as: E{\_}B = 931.5 * Delta(m)







Binding energy per nucleon, the energy that is equired to bind an individual unit (proton or neutron) in the nucleus, ranges between 7.5 and 8.8 MeV








Magic numbers for protons and neutrons: 2, 8, 10, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126








Four types of Radionuclides
1) Long-lived (slowly-decaying radoactive parents)
Example: U-234, Th-232, K-40
2) Atoms that are the result of the decay of the long-lived parents metioned in 1)
Example: U-234, Ra-226, Th-230
3) Produced by the nuclear reactions that occur in nature
Example: C-14, Be-10, Si-32
4) Products of anthropogenic nuclear fission (nuclear waste/fallout)








Oddo-Hawkins Rule: Take the log{\_}10 of the abundances of the elements in the solar system and you get a zig-zag or a sawtooth pattern (see bottom of page 10 and the middle of page 12 for the eight takeaway points)








Total amount of heat released by the proton-proton chain is 19.794 MeV (page 13)








Be-8 has a very short halflife (7E-17 seconds) and requires another He-4 (alpha particle) imedediately after its formation (keep in mind that two heliums make a Be-8) in order to stablize (thus stable product is the common C-12)








For atoms with atomic numbers greater than 26 (Fe), they will generally 'resort' to using neutron capture. This occurs through two different mechanisms:
1) s-process: radioactive products from neutron capture decay to a stable product before the next neutron capture occurs. This is a slow process
2) r-process: the opposite of s-process where neutron capture occurs before the products have time to decay},

abstract = {Pipeline safety in the United States has increased in recent decades, but incidents involving natural gas pipelines still cause an average of 17 fatalities and {\$}133 M in property damage annually. Natural gas leaks are also the largest anthropogenic source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in the U.S. To reduce pipeline leakage and increase consumer safety, we deployed a Picarro G2301 Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer in a car, mapping 5893 natural gas leaks (2.5 to 88.6 ppm CH4) across 1500 road miles of Washington, DC. The \delta(13)C-isotopic signatures of the methane (-38.2‰ ± 3.9‰ s.d.) and ethane (-36.5 ± 1.1 s.d.) and the CH4:C2H6 ratios (25.5 ± 8.9 s.d.) closely matched the pipeline gas (-39.0‰ and -36.2‰ for methane and ethane; 19.0 for CH4/C2H6). Emissions from four street leaks ranged from 9200 to 38,200 L CH4 day(-1) each, comparable to natural gas used by 1.7 to 7.0 homes, respectively. At 19 tested locations, 12 potentially explosive (Grade 1) methane concentrations of 50,000 to 500,000 ppm were detected in manholes. Financial incentives and targeted programs among companies, public utility commissions, and scientists to reduce leaks and replace old cast-iron pipes will improve consumer safety and air quality, save money, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Earth's climate is warming as a result of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from fossil fuel combustion. Anthropogenic emissions of non-CO(2) greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone-depleting substances (largely from sources other than fossil fuels), also contribute significantly to warming. Some non-CO(2) greenhouse gases have much shorter lifetimes than CO(2), so reducing their emissions offers an additional opportunity to lessen future climate change. Although it is clear that sustainably reducing the warming influence of greenhouse gases will be possible only with substantial cuts in emissions of CO(2), reducing non-CO(2) greenhouse gas emissions would be a relatively quick way of contributing to this goal.},

abstract = {A study has been made of the applicability of gas-liquid partition chromatography to the quantitative analysis of complex mixtures of hydrocarbon gases. The results indicate that good resolution of most of the hydrocar- bons through CJ can be achieved with a two-stage col- umn in which the sample is partitioned first by diiso- decylphthalate and then by dimethylsulfolane. Use of a 50-foot column containing only dimethylsulfolane separates isobutylene from 1-butene and gives excellent resolution of the pentenes. Helium is used as the car- rier gas and the column effluent is monitored by con- tinuously recording its thermal conductivity. Re- corded curves for several hydrocarbon mixtures illus- trate the separations that are achieved. Qualitatively, the method permits the separation and identification of all the commonly encountered hydrocarbon gases. 4 good quantitative measure of composition is obtained from the distribution of area under the peaks of the recorded curves.},

abstract = {Relationships between three-dimensional fracture networks consisting of polydisperse disks and the corresponding two-dimensional trace maps are systematically analyzed. Bulk densities of disks and disk intersections are related to surface densities of traces and trace intersections; this results in a new relation for the average length of disk intersections. The probability densities of trace lengths and disk intersections are studied for several disk diameter distributions. The inverse problem of deriving the disk distribution from the trace distribution is then solved, assuming only that the disks have uniformly random locations and orientations. These results are applied to a variety of synthetically generated data, as well as to several sets of field data. Analysis of the field data suggests that fracture diameter distributions follow a power law, in agreement with previous conclusions based on trace length histograms, with exponents varying from 1.3 to 2.1.},

@phdthesis{Osholake2010,
abstract = {Unconventional reservoirs such as shale, hydrates, tight sand, ultra tight sand and coal bed methane reservoirs serves as alternative sources to meet the increasing demand for energy here in the US and all over the world. The exploitation of unconventional gas reservoirs has become an integral part of the North American gas supply. The economic viability of many unconventional gas developments hinges on the effective stimulation of extremely low permeability reservoir rocks. With improve drilling and stimulation technologies, many unconventional plays have become realistic contributors to the energy budget. The Marcellus shale reservoir contains large amount of natural gas resources and its proximity to high demand markets along the East Coast of the United States makes it an attractive target for energy development. According to Arthur et al (2008), the estimated original gas in place in the Marcellus shale is 1,500 TCF (Trillion Cubic Foot) which when compared to other shale plays in the United States almost doubles the estimated gas in place associated with other shale reservoirs. So, it is crucial for exploration and production companies to invest in the Marcellus shale. Hydraulic fracturing technique is the stimulation method of choice in shale gas reservoirs.Even though hydraulic fracturing technique improves ultimate gas recovery, they are several factors that occur after hydraulic fracture treatment that impacts the production of natural gas from a hydraulically fractured shale gas well. These factors include: multi phase flow of gas and water, proppant crushing, proppant diagenesis, interaction of fracture fluid with reservoir particles, relative permeability, capillary pressure, reservoir permeability change, operational conditions, and reservoir heterogeneity among others. This research study was undertaken to quantify the impact of selected post hydraulic fracture factors that affects shale gas wells. With the use of commercial reservoir simulation software that models cumulative production and production flow rate from a vertical well located in a 160 acre Marcellus shale gas reservoir, we are able to quantify how much impact this various factors will have on the ultimate gas recovered from the reservoir under consideration. An ideal case single phase flow was simulated and was used as the base result for which simulation results of other factors was compared. The new knowledge from this research should enable engineers to better design fracture treatments and helps operators manage the wells in the Marcellus shale formation. The observation and recommendations will also be useful for further studies in this area.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature.},

@article{Bousquet2006a,
abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, and its atmospheric concentration has nearly tripled since pre-industrial times. The growth rate of atmospheric methane is determined by the balance between surface emissions and photochemical destruction by the hydroxyl radical, the major atmospheric oxidant. Remarkably, this growth rate has decreased markedly since the early 1990s, and the level of methane has remained relatively constant since 1999, leading to a downward revision of its projected influence on global temperatures. Large fluctuations in the growth rate of atmospheric methane are also observed from one year to the next, but their causes remain uncertain. Here we quantify the processes that controlled variations in methane emissions between 1984 and 2003 using an inversion model of atmospheric transport and chemistry. Our results indicate that wetland emissions dominated the inter-annual variability of methane sources, whereas fire emissions played a smaller role, except during the 1997-1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o event. These top-down estimates of changes in wetland and fire emissions are in good agreement with independent estimates based on remote sensing information and biogeochemical models. On longer timescales, our results show that the decrease in atmospheric methane growth during the 1990s was caused by a decline in anthropogenic emissions. Since 1999, however, they indicate that anthropogenic emissions of methane have risen again. The effect of this increase on the growth rate of atmospheric methane has been masked by a coincident decrease in wetland emissions, but atmospheric methane levels may increase in the near future if wetland emissions return to their mean 1990s levels.},

@article{Alvarez2012a,
abstract = {Natural gas is seen by many as the future of American energy: a fuel that can provide energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process. However, there has also been confusion about the climate implications of increased use of natural gas for electric power and transportation. We propose and illustrate the use of technology warming potentials as a robust and transparent way to compare the cumulative radiative forcing created by alternative technologies fueled by natural gas and oil or coal by using the best available estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from each fuel cycle (i.e., production, transportation and use). We find that a shift to compressed natural gas vehicles from gasoline or diesel vehicles leads to greater radiative forcing of the climate for 80 or 280 yr, respectively, before beginning to produce benefits. Compressed natural gas vehicles could produce climate benefits on all time frames if the well-to-wheels CH(4) leakage were capped at a level 45-70{\%} below current estimates. By contrast, using natural gas instead of coal for electric power plants can reduce radiative forcing immediately, and reducing CH(4) losses from the production and transportation of natural gas would produce even greater benefits. There is a need for the natural gas industry and science community to help obtain better emissions data and for increased efforts to reduce methane leakage in order to minimize the climate footprint of natural gas.},

abstract = {The vibrancy of a lawn is tied closely to a home's perceived appearance and value, leading many homeowners to apply quantities of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to their lawns. Application of N fertilizer to agricultural soils has been shown to release nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) with a 100 year global warming potential (GWP) of {\~{}}300 that can also cause depletion of stratospheric ozone. N2O emissions from urban and suburban lawns have been measured in only a few places. Such measurements are needed to create regional GHG inventories. A method was developed to sample the soil flux of N2O from lawns and determine quantitatively the effect of fertilization on N2O emissions. Sampling was accomplished using closed chambers constructed of 8-inch SCH 40 PVC, deployed for 30 minutes with soil moisture and temperature monitored using time-domain reflectrometry and thermistors, respectively. N2O concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector. This sampling method proved useful},

@article{Reichman2000b,
abstract = {Chambers are commonly used to measure the emission of many trace gases and chemicals from soil. An aerodynamic (flow through) chamber was designed and fabricated to accurately measure the sur- face flux of trace gases. Flow through the chamber was controlled with a small vacuum at the outlet. Due to the design using fans, a partition plate, and aerodynamic ends, air is forced to sweep parallel and uniform over the entire soil surface. A fraction of the air flowing inside the chamber is sampled in the outlet. The air velocity inside the chamber is controlled by fan speed and outlet suction flow rate. The chamber design resulted in a uniform distribution of air velocity at the soil surface. Steady state flux was attained within 5 min when the outlet air suction rate was 20 L/min or higher. For expected flux rates, the presence of the chamber did not affect the measured fluxes at outlet suction rates of around 20 L/min, except that the chamber caused some cooling of the surface in field experiments. Sensitive measurements of the pressure deficit across the soil layer in conjunc- tion with measured fluxes in the source box and chamber outlet show that the outflow rate must be controlled carefully to minimize errors in the flux measurements. Both over- and underestimation of the fluxes are possible if the outlet flow rate is not controlled carefully. For this design, the chamber accurately measured steady flux at outlet air suction rates of approximately 20 L/min when the pressure deficit within the chamber with respect to the ambient atmosphere ranged between 0.46 and 0.79 Pa.

@article{Laurenzi2013,
abstract = {We present results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of Marcellus shale gas used for power generation. The analysis employs the most extensive data set of any LCA of shale gas to date, encompassing data from actual gas production and power generation operations. Results indicate that a typical Marcellus gas life cycle yields 466 kg CO2eq/MWh (80{\%} confidence interval: 450-567 kg CO2eq/MWh) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 224 gal/MWh (80{\%} CI: 185-305 gal/MWh) of freshwater consumption. Operations associated with hydraulic fracturing constitute only 1.2{\%} of the life cycle GHG emissions, and 6.2{\%} of the life cycle freshwater consumption. These results are influenced most strongly by the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of the well and the power plant efficiency: increase in either quantity will reduce both life cycle freshwater consumption and GHG emissions relative to power generated at the plant. We conclude by comparing the life cycle impacts of Marcellus gas and U.S. coal: The carbon footprint of Marcellus gas is 53{\%} (80{\%} CI: 44-61{\%}) lower than coal, and its freshwater consumption is about 50{\%} of coal. We conclude that substantial GHG reductions and freshwater savings may result from the replacement of coal-fired power generation with gas-fired power generation.},

abstract = {Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are transforming energy production, but their potential environmental effects remain controversial. We analyzed 141 drinking water wells across the Appalachian Plateaus physiographic province of northeastern Pennsylvania, examining natural gas concentrations and isotopic signatures with proximity to shale gas wells. Methane was detected in 82{\%} of drinking water samples, with average concentrations six times higher for homes {\textless}1 km from natural gas wells (P = 0.0006). Ethane was 23 times higher in homes {\textless}1 km from gas wells (P = 0.0013); propane was detected in 10 water wells, all within approximately 1 km distance (P = 0.01). Of three factors previously proposed to influence gas concentrations in shallow groundwater (distances to gas wells, valley bottoms, and the Appalachian Structural Front, a proxy for tectonic deformation), distance to gas wells was highly significant for methane concentrations (P = 0.007; multiple regression), whereas distances to valley bottoms and the Appalachian Structural Front were not significant (P = 0.27 and P = 0.11, respectively). Distance to gas wells was also the most significant factor for Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (P {\textless} 0.01). For ethane concentrations, distance to gas wells was the only statistically significant factor (P {\textless} 0.005). Isotopic signatures ($\delta$(13)C-CH4, $\delta$(13)C-C2H6, and $\delta$(2)H-CH4), hydrocarbon ratios (methane to ethane and propane), and the ratio of the noble gas (4)He to CH4 in groundwater were characteristic of a thermally postmature Marcellus-like source in some cases. Overall, our data suggest that some homeowners living {\textless}1 km from gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases.},
