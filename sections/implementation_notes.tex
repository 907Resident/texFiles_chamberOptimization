\section{Some Implementation Notes}
The workflow for solving the problem looks like:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read in image of the field site
\item Using colors determine which areas are off limits
\item Use ellipses to cover the off-limit areas for the reverse convex model
\item Solve the sensor placement problem 
\item Using some simulation, determine the collected ``data" by the algorithmically placed sensors
\item Create model for entire field
\item Compare to simulated truth
\end{enumerate}
